## **Critical Update**

**I have divided the document into individual links per section for 2 reasons:**

1. To address the viewer limitation cap issue that occurred.
2. To provide a less overwhelming experience

**Introduction**

**What is this document?**
It is a collection of options, ideas, and strategies on how to resist the 2025 coup.


**This document's goals:**

**Goal 1** 
Urge people to protest in person.

**Goal 2** 
Show how to resist at home.


**What is my agenda?**
Resist the Trump administration, resist a dark future for the USA, and to resist big tech's influence.


**Why is all of this happening?**
There is not a single reason, but a confluence of reasons:

1. Billionaires want [**private ](https://theplotagainstamerica.com/)[city-states](https://theplotagainstamerica.com/ "https://theplotagainstamerica.com/")**.
2. Billionaires [**dislike democracy**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RpPTRcz1no&ab_channel=BlondePolitics%7CTheSillySerious "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RpPTRcz1no&ab_channel=BlondePolitics%7CTheSillySerious").
3. Extremist Christians see God as authoritarian, and prefer that same governance structure.
4. China and Russia dislike US hegemony, NATO, and post WWII world order.
5. White supremacists want an all-white nation.
6. Hate groups want “the groups they dislike” to be dealt with.

Russia has amplified the negative emotions of hate groups, Extremist Christians, and white supremacists. China has large influence over younger people because of TikTok. Billionaires have influence over each of us due to our reliance on Big Tech. The Extremist Christian groups, and the racist hate groups, are also being used to create chaos and fear within the USA.

But the main way to combat each of these entities is to protest and resist.


**What will decide who wins?**
My speculation is simple. I believe these forces, and others, are fighting for control over natural resources, water, space, nuclear bombs, money, and work forces (indentured or cheap). Minimum wage workers, H1B, Prison Labor, Slave Labor, and even Robot Labor are likely expected to contribute to the tech bro fiefdoms they wish to create.

DT and EM want Greenland, Canada, Ukraine’s resources, and the Panama Canal because it aligns with the tech bro goals. The [**Gold Card Citizenship**](https://time.com/7261958/what-is-gold-card-trump-citizenship-route-how-it-might-work/) cards is a way for Trump to grift money, but also as a way to bring wealth in from outside of the country to potentially fund the tech bro cities.

Use DuckDuckGo to find footage of protests for motivation. The media isn’t covering the protests as they should, but the footage is out there.

## **1.2**
**Protest Dates**


[**50501 Protest**](https://linktr.ee/FiftyFiftyOneMovement "https://linktr.ee/FiftyFiftyOneMovement")
Protests and protest guides.

[**Mobilize.us**](http://Mobilize.us "http://Mobilize.us")
Local protests and events.
[
](https://events.pol-rev.com/search?search&contentType=EVENTS "https://events.pol-rev.com/search?search&contentType=EVENTS")[**Political Revolution**](https://events.pol-rev.com/search?search&contentType=EVENTS "https://events.pol-rev.com/search?search&contentType=EVENTS")
Protests organized by date.

[**US Protests Map**](https://usprotests.liveuamap.com/ "https://usprotests.liveuamap.com/")
Connects protests to links.


50501 is the most reliable protest entity right now. 

However, DuckDuckGo searches can help you find new groups to join.

## **1.3**
**Sick Outs**

A sick out is when a lot of people within the same company or institution call in sick simultaneously specifically to disrupt the company, or an industry. There are 2 ways to do this:

1. Get everyone to Sick Out
2. Get enough people to sick out to cause disruption

Some people are going to prioritize their job over the collective action. Some people have also run out of sick days and have a harder time participating because they lose money or risk their job. Therefore, people who don't participate might have a reason, so be careful in judgments.

Organize sick outs behind the scenes with vetted co-workers.

## **1.4**
**Civil Disobedience**

The CIA's short guide for [**conducting civil disobedience**](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26184 "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26184").

Civil disobedience can sometimes be petty. But to be effective, it must confer a message or ideal. Here are recent examples:

[**US Army Chorus**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIQh_5dZUwI "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIQh_5dZUwI")

[**Yosemite National Park**](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/1iwdq3x/american_flag_flown_upside_down_represented_as_a/ "https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/1iwdq3x/american_flag_flown_upside_down_represented_as_a/")

[**Zion National Park**](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1jafnh1/zion_standing_up_today/ "https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1jafnh1/zion_standing_up_today/")

[**DT licking EM’s Toes**](https://bsky.app/profile/marisakabas.bsky.social/post/3liwlwvvq6k2s "https://bsky.app/profile/marisakabas.bsky.social/post/3liwlwvvq6k2s")

[**Anonymous Disobedience**](https://www.reddit.com/r/50501/comments/1jbvrg4/us_what_happened_to_twitter_and_snapchat_is_not/ "https://www.reddit.com/r/50501/comments/1jbvrg4/us_what_happened_to_twitter_and_snapchat_is_not/")

[**Modern Examples**](https://www.yourdictionary.com/articles/civil-disobedience-examples "https://www.yourdictionary.com/articles/civil-disobedience-examples")

Civil Disobedience is sometimes petty, sometimes serious, and sometimes humorous. But it always makes a point.

Bringing friends to protests can help you split costs, and it increases the number of people at the protest. Protesting with friends is also a way to build community, and become better friends with that person / people.

***

## **1.6**
**Universal Messaging**

**They Lied to Us!**
Make “They Lied to Us!” signs and shirts.

**American Flags**
Bring an American Flag to the protest.

**Overturn Citizens United**
Citizens united quiets the voices of the citizens and amplifies the speech of companies. It must go.

**Pledge of Allegiance**
Use [**the pledge of allegiance**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEMqQcUCzio&ab_channel=Tennessean) to disrupt lawmakers.

**Resist Divisive Messaging**
It feels good, but pushes people away. Right now, we need anyone and everyone who turns on DT and his allies. Avoid divisive messaging when possible.

**Join a Union**

Join a union if you can. It is an instant community to help fight for your rights.

**Do Not Be Silent**

Silence empowers the oppressor. Silence isn’t voice. Silence is complicity.

## **1.9**
**Accept Your Role**

We are the last line of defense. No one is going to save us but us. Internalize this mantra. Until democrats do what the people want, they won’t save us.

Use the [**Activist Handbook**](https://activisthandbook.org/organising/protest "https://activisthandbook.org/organising/protest").

The [**Movement Building 101**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IbI2KEaN09j1WIsEMWQqBfbWJv0jPN04WteFX6H79Eg/edit?usp=drivesdk) spreadsheet is also under development from a different person - check it out.

**Maximize Numbers**
When organizing your own group, maximize your group's effectiveness by joining larger schedule protests. It is the massive collective that can implement grassroots changes.

Try to find things in common with other groups, and make signage that coordinates with them.

2. Watch this [**41 minute video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru8SHK7idxs&t=31s&ab_channel=ElectionTruthAlliance "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru8SHK7idxs&t=31s&ab_channel=ElectionTruthAlliance")

The bottom line is simple: various groups believe they have enough power to destroy not just the USA, but democracy. The claims of election interference this time around seem much more legitimate as the Election Truth Alliance is seeking to go to court to prove it (as opposed to making baseless claims).

# **Section 3**

# **Recruitment**

## 
**3.1**
**Recruit**

### **Recruiting Trusted People**

Encourage them to attend protests with you, and to read this document.

A trusted person can also stand in opposition to you, like a family member. When making an appeal, make it personal. Share how things affect you.

For the LGBTQ+ community, if you are not out to this person, always be careful, and use your best judgment.

### **Recruiting Acquaintances**

Here are tips on determining a person's politics before recruiting:

1. Observe their actions
2. Do their actions and words align?
3. Do they do the following:
    1. Complain about people?
    2. Complain about ideas?
    3. Complain about politics?

Complaining about people is usually critical, and not critical thinking. Complaining about ideas and concepts is a much higher form of critical thinking because it means they are trying to assess a larger issue. Complaining about politics gives huge hints into a person's views.

**Hot Button Issues**
You can also discuss topics that are akin to hot button issues to extract a person’s opinions. 

Here are examples:

- Can James Bond be a woman?
- Talk about giving homeless people money.
- Where do they send their kids to school, and why?
- What kind of church do they attend, if any?
- Talk about vaccinating your kids.

Be careful when speaking to people you do not know well.

### **Recruiting Opposition**

Use the following tips for recruiting opposition:

- Wait for moments of doubt
- Resist “I told ya so!” messaging

The goal is to defeat authoritarianism, and we need all the help we can get. We can tackle individual differences later.

**Simple Speech**
If you are indeed recruiting a full on MAGA, or trying to, use simple speech and ideas. Yes, this sounds insulting, but there is scientific evidence to back it up. 

Pete Buttigieg [**gives an example here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx62pk3kwf8&t=106s). He breaks DEI down in a very relatable way.

### **Racism & Recruiting**

I believe calling people “Racist” is unhelpful when making progress toward a non-racist world. Every person exists on the [**racism spectrum**](https://stuartcenter.org/resource/racism-scale "https://stuartcenter.org/resource/racism-scale") (or racism scale).

This matters because when recruiting people to fight against authoritarianism, they are less likely to coalesce with the group if they are at a certain point on the racism scale.

Therefore, keep this in mind when recruiting people. Recruiting a stranger can be good, but it might be good to feel out how racist they might be.

When you recognize that racism is on a spectrum, you can begin to work on yourself, and you can work with others to lower their temperature towards another race. Rejection of this concept will mean you might not be ready to form coalitions, or be part of the wider community.

Know thyself, and be mindful.

***

## **3.2**

## **Debating MAGA**

**In-Person Debates**
Bots, trolls, AI, infotainment, and bad actors have made internet debate useless if your goal is progress. Therefore, in-person debates are more useful.

When in an in-person debate with MAGA, understand that most people change their minds later on, when away from a debate. Here are tips for preparing for MAGA debates:

1. [**This article**](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/good-thinking/201602/how-get-people-change-their-minds "https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/good-thinking/201602/how-get-people-change-their-minds") has excellent tips.
2. [**This article**](https://time.com/6224300/how-to-change-someones-mind/ "https://time.com/6224300/how-to-change-someones-mind/") is also useful.
3. [**Watch Pete Buttigieg**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx62pk3kwf8&t=106s) explain how the opposite of DEI is Uniformity, Inequality, and Exclusion.

There are a million articles on changing someone’s mind, and they all give different, but usually reasonable, advice. Just know that showing up prepared to a debate, even an unexpected one, increases your chances of success.

**Online Debates**
Give a person a sentence or two at most. Otherwise, use B.R.I.M.:

1. Block
2. Report
3. Ignore
4. Move on

**No Reaction**
When MAGA is being vile and rude, give no reaction. They experience a dopamine hit when they anger you. If you have no reaction, it leaves them with the anger. 

Let them feel those feelings, and you can move on from them.

**Providing Research**
When online, if you are challenged to show evidence in a calm manner, oblige once. If challenged in a rude or aggressive way, don’t bother. 

Your time is valuable, and the chances of changing their mind online are low.

**Use Simple Language**
MAGA understands the words Trump uses, but not how he uses them. Trump uses smaller words, common words, and avoids scientific words. You can do this, too, while trying to get a point across.

**Turning People Away**
Like it or not, we need MAGA on our side. Not all of it, just a big enough chunk of it. 

Focus on the pain DT, EM, and JDV causes MAGA. Make MAGA re-live those moments when they show doubt but refuse to open their eyes.

***

## **3.3**
**Make MAGA Feel**

MAGA hates consequences, but consequences can make MAGA feel:

**Family**
MAGA hates divided families. They have a purest view of what a family is, and division isn’t part of that viewpoint. Walking away from family is hard, but living under an authoritarian regime is harder. 

**Section 9: Option 3** demonstrates strategies for walking away from family.

**Work**
If you are a business owner, consider firing MAGA workers. This may seem very harsh, but consider the following:

1. [**EM](https://fortune.com/2025/02/28/tesla-elon-musk-jared-ottmann/)[ fires people for their views](https://fortune.com/2025/02/28/tesla-elon-musk-jared-ottmann/ "https://fortune.com/2025/02/28/tesla-elon-musk-jared-ottmann/")
2. [**Political views aren't protected**](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/can-employers-discriminate-based-on-political-beliefs-or-affiliation.html "https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/can-employers-discriminate-based-on-political-beliefs-or-affiliation.html")
3. MAGA always fights to be able to fire LGBTQ+ people.

You do not need to suddenly fire them (though, you can). But for example, if you have to do layoffs, firing the people who put us all in this situation is reasonable. Let them pay for the problems they’ve caused us all first.

Like all options in this document, this is optional. MAGA feeling financial and emotional pain is one of our only ways to get through to the majority of them.

**Friendships**
MAGA values friendships, but less so than family. 

However, abandoning a long relationship will make MAGA feel pain, and they may have to re-evaluate their stance.

**Church**
If your church is MAGA, find a new church.

**Helping MAGA**
If you regularly help a MAGA, stop. Whatever the help, just stop. Let MAGA rely upon itself, and stop draining you and your resources.

**3.4**
**Subscribe**

[**Here is a verified list**](https://airtable.com/appjR7HCkVYNu9ZZS/shrZ9cqMyi8fAEb4y/tblrqBrYbbyKYJDxN) of streamers, podcasts, and other online groups that do not support Donald Trump.

I am putting this under recruitment because if we all follow each of these, their online numbers will grow and our voice will be amplified.

***

## 
**3.5**
**Unsubscribe**

Unsubscribe from the following people, channels, or groups:

1. People who support DT / MAGA
2. People who avoid the discussion

If a person has a channel that talks about building bird houses, and there is no cause for politics discussion, you don't have to unsubscribe from them. 

However, the goal is to challenge authoritarianism. If a person is not calling out the regime for what it is, they likely don't deserve support.

Silence emboldens the oppressor. There is no reason to support silent individuals. They are the individuals who will watch you get dragged away. They are the individuals who will turn you in to save themselves. They are the individuals who will rationalize heinous acts against people to keep their job.

# **Section 4**
**Limit Spending**

## 
**4.1**
**Open Secrets & GUU**

Use the following links to look up corporation political donations before making purchases:

1. The** [Goods Unite Us](https://www.goodsuniteus.com/ "https://www.goodsuniteus.com/")** app
2. [**www.OpenSecrets.org**](http://www.OpenSecrets.org "http://www.OpenSecrets.org")
3. [**All MAGA Supporting Stores**](https://business.publicsquare.com/about-publicsquare)

Option 3 is a website that shows stores that specifically share MAGA values.
You can search it by zip code.
Use their website as a catalog of where ***NOT*** to shop.

## **4.2**
**S.A.V.E.**

Trim your expenses with SAVE:

**Select**
Select products and services you ***must*** use, and keep using them.

**Assess**
Determine whether a product or service can be purchased elsewhere.

**Verify**
If you cannot buy the product elsewhere, is there an alternative?

**Eliminate**
For all products and services, see if you can eliminate it from your life.

Shift all of your spending habits away from big corporations and toward local business, independent people, and smaller companies.

**Spending Tips**

- Seriously limit spending
- Eliminate debt
- Avoid recurring payments
- Avoid micro-transactions
- Avoid loans
- Avoid using credit cards
- Avoid convenience spending

Some of this is easier said than done, but try your best. If your spending grinds to a halt, you’ll save more money, and you will be increasing your resistance.

**Saving Tips**

- Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
- Organize clothing swaps
- Book exchanges
- Share seeds for planting
- Organize potlucks
- Organized bulk purchasing
- Share equipment
- Organize tool libraries
- Share skills
- Swap meets
- Game Night
- Movie Night
- Carpool networking
- Invest in shared bikes
- Community emergency fund
- Trade furniture
- Learn DIY skills
- Freecycling

**No Buy November**
Organize a neighborhood-wide Swap Meet aimed at lowering purchases in November.

**Neighborhood Sharing Agreements**
Ask neighbors to participate in a sharing agreement where everyone lists infrequently used objects that others can be used. Infrequently used items can include things like lawnmowers, snowblowers, power washers, camping gear.

Either each object comes with a maintenance cost that must be paid in advance, or the sharing agreement requires an upfront maintenance fee to be collected annually.

**Homeowner's Association**
One of the good things about homeowner's associations is they collect money to pay for services such as street clearing, lawn care, etc... If done properly, the neighborhood association negotiates to get the best pricing. Year-to-year profits should roll over into an emergency fund, and a capital improvement fund for things like street paving.

Neighborhoods can also negotiate for bulk purchases for things like top soil, potting mix, mulch, and many other ideas.

**Limit Overlapping Expenses**
Rotate subscriptions to streaming services.

**Prioritize Experiences Over Purchases**
Organizing free activities, swap meets, neighborhood sharing agreements, and other similar ideas encourage community building and less wasteful spending.

**S.A.V.E. Checklist**

#### **Shared Resources**

- Share large equipment among multiple households.
- Create a neighborhood inventory list of items to borrow/lend.
- Split streaming services or subscriptions where allowed.

#### **Rotate & Limit Subscriptions**

#### **Group Buying Power**

- Organize bulk purchases for groceries, cleaning supplies, etc.
- Approach local businesses for community discounts (e.g., gym, home repairs).
- Share coupons, deals, and discounts within the group.

#### **Reduce Convenience Spending**

- Start a neighborhood freecycle or swap group (clothes, furniture, toys, etc.).
- Meal prep together or create a rotating meal plan to avoid excessive takeout.
- Plan potlucks and group gatherings instead of dining out.

#### **DIY & Skill Sharing**

- Pool skills for basic home repairs, car maintenance, sewing, etc.
- Organize occasional “repair days” or “DIY workshops” within the community.
- Share tools and supplies for home or craft projects.

#### **Transportation Savings**

## **4.3**
**Move Your Money**

**Credit Unions**
Credit Unions are owned by people, and not billionaires. Moving your money diminishes the profits billionaires can make by loaning out your money.

**Local Banks**
Local banks are owned by local people, and not billionaires. They are an excellent option, especially if you cannot join a credit union.

***

## **4.4**
**Cash is King**

Use cash and pre-paid debit cards. This makes your purchases un-trackable, and thus un-exploitable.

### 

### **Citizen’s Embargo**

A *Citizen’s Embargo* is when we boycott products made within the USA that other countries have levies against. This means those companies not only feel economic pain internationally, but also at home.

For example, Kentucky’s bourbon industry is feeling a lot of economic pain. Bourbon brings in nearly [**$10 billion annually**](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/bourbon-industry-crosshairs-us-canada-trade-war-rcna195906 "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/bourbon-industry-crosshairs-us-canada-trade-war-rcna195906") to Kentucky.

Therefore, boycotting products you buy that other countries have tariffs against is a huge level of resistance, and moreso if you recruit others.

### Limit Spending

Targeted boycotts work.

However, it cannot be emphasized enough that we must all limit spending as much as possible. Big tech and big businesses simply have too much money, and money is the only thing they understand. So, we must take it away, and reinvest into individuals, small businesses, and community.

[**Here is a video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-Imw_s1aaI "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-Imw_s1aaI&t=1742s&ab_channel=EdwardNiedermeyer") that explains the financial technicalities of boycotting Tesla. 

EM used [**Tesla as collateral**](https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/25/23141940/elon-musk-tesla-twitter-margin-loan-buyout-deal "https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/25/23141940/elon-musk-tesla-twitter-margin-loan-buyout-deal") when buying Twitter. 

Therefore, if Tesla’s stock drops too low, the creditors who loaned EM money will make margin calls against EM, causing him to lose a lot of money, and Twitter, his main propaganda machine.

**Stigmatize the Brand**
Here is how:

1. Encourage others to sell their Teslas.
2. Discourage others from buying Tesla.
3. Share social media posts about people who sold their Teslas.
4. Share social media posts about negativity toward Tesla / Teslas
5. Like / Heart / Share / Upvote negative views and images of Tesla.
6. Refer to Teslas as “Swasticars.”
7. If your state requires front and back license plates, call the police when you see a Tesla or Cybertruck without a front plate.
8. [**This video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQJL3htsDyQ) shows Tesla technology is not as safe as other self-driving cars.

**Washington Post**

Cancel your Washington Post subscription because [**JB directed**](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5309725/jeff-bezos-washington-post-opinion-section "https://www.npr.org/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5309725/jeff-bezos-washington-post-opinion-section") the Washington Post to only cover right wing issues.

**Supporting Journalism**
Reach out to the journalists who you like at WaPo, and ask them *"What is the link for your substack?"* 

You can look it up without asking them, but this will send a message that we respect them, but not the paper they work for. 

Then, follow them.

## **4.8**
**Buycotts**

Support companies that have reasonable policies, and don’t flip flop based on election cycles:

1. Costco
2. Aldi
3. Trader Joe’s

Each of these companies have good policies, and pay their workers appropriately.

## **4.9**
**Tithing**

If your religious institution supports MAGA, consider tithing elsewhere (or attending church elsewhere).

***

## **4.10**
**Holidays**

Make the holidays about food, family, and friends, and less about stuff. Here are ideas on how to limit holiday expenditures:

1. Spending caps
2. Potlucks
3. Needs over Wants

Celebrate any and all holidays you want, and celebrate them with whom you want. But consider reducing your spending.

***

## **4.11**
**Fast Food**

Fast Food prices are no longer wallet friendly, and most fast food chains support MAGA with political donations. Here are ways to resist:

**30 Meals**
If you lean to cook 30 meals and you eat each meal twice, that covers 2 meals per day for about 1 month.

**3 Meals per Week**
If you cook 3 bigger meals per week, like Chili, you can cook less.

**Embrace Leftovers**
Don’t cook meals that taste worse as leftovers. Focus on meals you will eat more than once.

**Rice and Spice**
Rice is cheap and spice is good – endless combinations are possible.

***

## **4.12**
**Streaming Platforms**

Maintain 1 streaming platform at a time. This will save you money, and if enough of us do this, the platforms will lower their prices.

***

## **4.13**
**Sports**

If your sports team is owned by a billionaire, stop supporting that team monetarily. Boycotting US Football, US Baseball, and US Basketball would have the largest impact.

I am excluding the WNBA and college sports from this suggestion... for now.

***

## **4.14**
**Repairmen**

Anytime you must hire people to work on your home, consider the following advice:

1. Don't hire based on TV ads.
2. Confirm if they have insurance.
3. Confirm if they have a license.

If they don't have a license, don't hire them. 

If they work on commissions, don't hire them.

**TV Hires**
Companies who advertise on TV very often pay commissions, which incentivizes tradespeople to charge more money, both for themselves and also so the company can label them a top earner (which means job security). A lot of companies that advertise on TV pay commissions, so this is the first sign.

**Insurance**
If they don't have insurance, and they get hurt in your home through something that is not your fault, you can get sued.

**License**
If they are unlicensed working in your home, you can get sued if they get hurt and they will likely get in trouble, too. It is bad for everyone involved.

**Commissions**
Some companies operate on commissions even if they don't advertise on TV. So, always ask.

**Best Practices**

Here is a list of best practices:

1. Find good repair people before you have a problem.
2. Ask friends who they have used and how their experience has been.
3. If possible, get 2 or 3 estimates before settling on a repair person.
    1. Either...
        1. ...tell none of them about the estimates
        2. ...or only tell the 3rd person.

## **Option 5.2 — Special Elections**

Several special elections are coming up that you need to support. If they win, the House of Representatives swings back to democrat control:

**New York**
[**Blake Gendebian**](https://blakegendebienforcongress.com/meet-blake/ "https://blakegendebienforcongress.com/meet-blake/")

### **Election Interference**

If DT and EM are cheating, and it seems like they are, it is important to keep voting for a few reasons:

- Force them to cheat again for future forensics teams
- Force them to continue election cycles
- Force the numbers to exceed the population in an area

Because of the census, we know about how many people are in an area. To maintain a lead in votes, but not to be too obvious about it, votes must be deleted. If this happens on a large enough scale, it will be clear cheating occurred.

Deportations of non-voting immigrants will still be cited as evidence for why a county, or state, is suddenly red. “It was the illegals voting!” will be the line. However, the census accounts for this information, too.

## **5.6**
**Identification**

Authoritarian regimes often require citizens to prove their citizenship, which can be difficult to do even if you are a legal citizen.

**Birth Certificate**
Put your birth certificate in an easy-to-find location.

If you do not have your birth certificate, you can get a new one printed up at your state’s department of vital records or department of health. 

You will need proof of ID, and mail with your name and address. Each state is different, so learn what else is needed.

**Driver’s License**
Even if you do not drive, obtaining your driver’s license can help you identify yourself. 

Get a Real ID. 

I am not providing a link to the Homeland Security website on this topic because government websites are compromised. However, DHS enforces each state issue Real IDs.

### **The SAVE Act**

[**Here is a non-partisan analysis**](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-save-act-overview-and-facts/ "https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-save-act-overview-and-facts/") of The SAVE Act.

**Women**
If your name differs from the one on your birth certificate due to marriage, you will be ineligible to vote due to the SAVE Act. There are a few ways to combat this:

1. Get your passport. Start now.
2. Change your name to your back.
3. Divorce while you can.

Any woman who divorces should change her name back to her birth name.

**Immigrants**
If you do not have a birth certificate, or one that the government will accept, focus on your passport.

***

## **5.7**
**4b Movement**

[**Project 2025**](https://www.project2025.observer/) will remove many women’s rights, including the right to vote. 

The 4b Movement is recognition that men are stripping women of their rights, and treat them poorly at all levels of society. 

If you are a single woman, or a woman in a questionable / horrible / abusive relationship, consider joining the 4b Movement.

The [**4b Movement Reddit page**](https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/ "https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/") has more information for any women who are considering joining the movement. Men should stay out of that group as it is a space for women.

They are being removed by police, and the politicians are not comporting themselves well.

***

## **5.9**

## **VOTE!!!**


**People who Always Vote**
Keep at it. 

Only give rides to the polls to like-minded people.

**People who Never Vote**
Please reconsider your values. 

Silence supports the oppressor. For example, imagine you witness someone beating a dog. If you watch, and do nothing, you are allowing it to continue, yes?

Same thing with voting – your lack of voting makes you complicit. You have 3 major options with regard to voting:

- Research candidates, and vote how you wish.
- Ask a person you respect who you should vote for.
- Vote with the most vulnerable person you know in mind.

**People in the MAGA Camp**
You will lose your rights, like the rest of us, under an authoritarian regime. We need you to come over and vote against republicans. MAGA is hurting everyone, whether they intended it or not.

Please consider the danger we are in.

**Cheating & Election Meddling**
As stated previously, we still need to vote even if there is a chance impropriety is occurring.

We must force them to cheat as much as we can so forensics teams can hold them accountable later.

***

## **5.10**
**Run for Office**

Run for office, and develop a platform that helps everyday people. 

EM is the perfect example of what happens when you have too much money. We need people who stand up to corporate interests and lobbyists.

To make this work, it means everyday citizens and local businesses will need to donate to political candidates. When those candidates take corporate money, we withdraw our funding and vote.

We need candidates who will overturn Citizens United.

If you are capable, or have a legitimate grievance, file lawsuits. 

Trump’s powers of immunity cover federal level offenses, but not civil offenses. Therefore, civil court may be a useful tool.

***

## **5.13**
**Taxes**

**Paying Taxes**
If you pay taxes, and do not get refunds, postmark your taxes for April 15th. 

This denies the government your money for as long as legally possible.

**Tax Refunds**
If you get a tax refund each year, pay your taxes as soon as possible to get money out of the government’s hands.

**Tax Strike**
[**I am monitoring chatter**](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/irs-doge-cuts-tax-filing-b2719911.html) about a tax strike -- this likely wouldn't matter until next year. Tax strikes are more effective when coordinated.

However, if enough people choose to not pay their taxes, it could be a huge blow to the administration.

Always do your own research, contact tax professionals, and weigh your options.

It is difficult to resist fascism while sick. Get vaccinated, and stay as informed as you can. Mask up, and use hand sanitizer.

**Stay Home When Sick**

Try your best not to spread sicknesses to other people.

However, if forced to work while sick, consider taking precautions from spreading your sickness, especially around those forcing you to work, optional.

If you find this suggestion ridiculous, then consider adopting the belief that if you are sick, you should be allowed to remain at home.

## **Post-It Protest**

Write well-reasoned, short , legible messages on post-it notes. 

Leave them at gas stations, grocery stores, and on cars where people will see them. 

Avoid insults. Make easy-to-research good points. Examples include the following:

- Trump fired people who oversee our nuclear weapons stockpile.
- There are $4.5 Trillion in tax cuts for the wealthy, and the total 2023 tax revenue was $4.47 Trillion. Coincidence?
- As fluoride gets banned, more cavities will occur, and dentist office waiting times will increase.
- Why are republicans considered the party of free speech, but they ban books, ban words from being used in government, and arrest people at protests?
- Inflation, egg prices, gas, and groceries are still up in price.
- Trump wants to take guns from “insane” people, and republicans are passing laws that do not list criteria for what the state can consider “insane.”
- Executive orders aren’t laws.
- If government jobs are wasteful and non-essential, why are government workers not allowed to protest?
- If you paid money into socil security, and it gets cut, didn’t you just get robbed?
- If government jobs don’t matter, why are China and Russia trying to recruit disgruntled federal workers?

**Block Fox News**

[**This reddit thread**](https://www.reddit.com/r/50501/comments/1ji4guj/how_to_block_fox_on_all_devices/) teaches people how to block Fox News. You can also block Fox News on any devices within your own home, too.

The purpose is to help prevent family members from being further degraded mentally. The post recommends doing this as a family decision.

Here is the text from the post, in case the post gets deleted (edited for brevity - if you want the full text go to the post's link above):

### Cable & Satellite TV

1. **Cancel / Downgrade**

- Call the cable provider and switch to a package that does **NOT** include Fox News.
- Some companies allow “à la carte” channel removal.

2. **Parental Controls / Channel Blocking**
This is a good option for households and retirement homes.

- Most cable/satellite providers let you block specific channels with a PIN.
- **How to block on major providers:**
    - **Xfinity (Comcast)** → Go to **Settings > Parental Controls > Block by Channel**
    - **Spectrum** → Use **Parental Controls** in **Settings**
    - **DirecTV** → Press **Menu > Settings > Parental Controls > Edit Channel List**
    - **Dish Network** → Menu > Preferences > Locks > Channel Locks


### Streaming Services (YouTube TV, Hulu, etc.)

1. **Cancel or Change the Plan**

- Many streaming services offer plans **WITHOUT** Fox News – downgrade to one.
- Example: Sling TV lets you remove Fox News by switching from **Sling Blue to Sling Orange**.

2. **Create Custom Profiles WITHOUT Fox News**

- On YouTube TV, Hulu, or Sling, set up a new profile and do **NOT** add Fox News to the favorites.

3. **Use Parental Controls / Channel Blocking**

- Most services let you block channels with a **PIN**
    - **YouTube TV** → Settings > Live Guide > Customize & Hide Fox News
    - **Hulu Live** → Manage Profiles > Turn Off News Channels


### Roku, Firestick, Apple TV, and Smart TVs

If they use **streaming devices**, you can **remove or block the Fox News app**:

1. **Remove Fox News App Completely**

- **Roku** → Press Home > Highlight Fox News > Press * > Remove Channel
- **Firestick** → Go to Apps > Highlight Fox News > Options > Uninstall
- **Apple TV** → Settings > General > Restrictions > Block Fox News

2. **Set Up Parental Controls & Restrict App Downloads**

- **Roku** → Settings > Parental Controls > Block News Apps
- **Firestick** → Settings > Preferences > Parental Controls > PIN for News Apps

3. **Block Fox News on Smart TVs**

- TV Settings > Parental Controls > Block Channels
- Remove Fox News from the TV Guide & Favorite Channels List


### Remove Fox News from Retirement Homes & Care Facilities

If your relative is in a retirement home or care facility, you may need to take extra steps:

1. **Request Channel Blocking on Facility Cable Systems**

- Speak with administrators and request Fox News be removed from the lineup.
- If multiple families request it, facilities may comply.

2. **Provide Alternative Conten**t

- Introduce them to PBS, NPR, or other non-toxic news sources.
- Give them access to streaming services to reduce TV news dependence.


### Why This Matters: The Psychological Impact of Fox News

Fox News preys on seniors by creating fear, paranoia, and anxiety. Many families have seen their loved ones:

- Become irrationally angry or aggressive.
- Start believing conspiracy theories.
- Cut off family members who don’t agree with them.
- Develop increased stress, depression, or paranoia.

Cutting off Fox News is not censorship—it’s protecting loved ones from corporate manipulation designed to exploit their fears.


### SHARE THIS & HELP OTHERS

If you know someone struggling with a loved one addicted to Fox News, help them take action. The more people who block Fox, the weaker their influence becomes.

Let’s reclaim our loved ones’ mental health, peace, and happiness.

## **Offline Plans**

Make offline plans with people. Here are reasons why:

**Flood the Zone** 
FTZ is intended to make you feel powerless, isolated, overwhelmed, and sad. One major way to combat this is to make in-person plans with others.

**Artificial Intelligence / Bots**
AI bots are draining people’s energy with negativity, downvotes, negative reactions, etc...

**Infotainment**
News sources like Fox News engage in infotainment rather than facts, which is a major part of the disinformation and misinformation campaigns waged by right wing and authoritarian forces.

**Trolls**
Trolls are willing and unwitting supporters of the powers that be, and they derive pleasure from your angst. You can never make them happy, and they are always negative.

**Bad Actors**
These are people with an agenda, and orders. They are paid at the government level to spread disinformation, hatred, lies, and anything that will stoke fear.

DT, EM, JVD, and all of the other collaborators are truly afraid of massive in-person demonstrations. This is every authoritarian regime’s fear. They always capitulate when this happens — look up the thousands of examples.

Organize in person, commiserate in person, support one another, build a network, and start meeting up with people in-person more and more.

**Cherry Tomatoes**
Cherry tomatoes take space to grow, but you get a lot of them.

**Crop Rotation**
Even in gardens, you must rotate crops year to year or disease occurs.

**Compost**
Composting creates nurtient-rich soil. As fertilizer and potting soil become harder to come by, compost will become *invaluable*.

A lot of the ideas in [**Section 4: Limit Spending**](https://drive.proton.me/urls/0DR4NF1X2R#4IUqcAPss8Px) could also be put in this section because of their community building potential.

***
 
# **Section 7**

# **De-Big Tech**

## 
**Why?**

In addition to financing the coup, they do all of the following:

- Monitor our communications
- Profit off our attention 
- Profit off our online data
- Weaponize their platforms

The only way to fight back is to deny the beast battle.

## **Incremental Removal**

**Step 1**
Use competing platforms.

**Step 2**
Do 1 thing per day to escape Big Tech.

Sometimes this will be smaller ideas and other times it will be bigger ideas.

**Step 3**
Change your habits. For example:

1. Don't login in for X days at a time
2. Stop making postss
3. Stop liking things
4. Stop scrolling, etc...

### **Three Big Tech Challenges**

- Privacy
- Blocking advertisements
- Confronting addiction

***Privacy***
Data exploitation requires a lack of privacy. However, a lot of tech prioritizes privacy, and those services are shared further down. We must start denying big tech ourselves, and reclaim our privacy.

***Blocking Advertisements***
Big Tech is addicted to ads like we are to big tech. Without advertisements, big tech crumbles. Therefore, when you cannot prioritize privacy, prioritize ad blocking. But doing both at once is best!

***Confronting Addiction***
We’re addicted to big tech, and that is by design. However, worse addictions exist. Before quitting cold turkey, try going 1 day without social media. Then 2 days, etc... Wen you get to a week, delete your account.

**Cold Turkey Tuesdays**
Quitting cold turkey is the best way to go. 

If you cannot do it all at once, try Cold Turkey Tuesdays where you do not login to any social media on Tuesdays.

## **7.1**
**DuckDuckGo**

[**DuckDuckGo**](https://duckduckgo.com/&search "https://duckduckgo.com/&search") is a search engine with privacy at its core. Use it instead of Google or Bing. 

DDG has a few useful links:

- [**About**](https://duckduckgo.com/app?origin=funnel_home_searchresults "https://duckduckgo.com/app?origin=funnel_home_searchresults") Teaches about their services
- [**Updates**](https://duckduckgo.com/updates "https://duckduckgo.com/updates") Teaches about new services and benefits

You can incorporate DuckDuckGo into most web browsers by going to their homepage.

**Controversy**
This [**DDG controversy**](https://www.knowyourmobile.com/data-privacy/the-duckduckgo-controversy/ "https://www.knowyourmobile.com/data-privacy/the-duckduckgo-controversy/") is worth noting.

## **7.2**
**LibreWolf**

[**LibreWolf**](https://librewolf.net/ "https://librewolf.net/") is a free web browser that prioritizes privacy and ad blocking simultaneously.

- [**About**](https://librewolf.net/#what-is-librewolf "https://librewolf.net/#what-is-librewolf")
- [**FAQ**](https://librewolf.net/docs/faq/ "https://librewolf.net/docs/faq/")

LibreWolf is free, and will always be free. They still recommend using DuckDuckGo, but have listed alternatives.

***

## **7.3**
**Orion Web Browser**

The [**Orion Web Browser**](https://kagi.com/orion/ "https://kagi.com/orion/") is another browser you can use. They have a $150 lifetime fee for their plus features. It is an excellent alternative to Safari for Apple users.

- Orion offers ad and tracker blocking for privacy
- Orion offers access to Chrome and Firefox extensions

Orion is specifically for MacOS and iOS.

***

## **7.4**
**Use Ad Blockers**

If you do not wish to change web browsers, consider using ad blockers. Ad blockers help you in 2 ways:

- You deny ad revenue
- You recover bandwidth

Every online ad uses bandwidth you pay for, without permission. 

Video ads are especially egregious. 

Stolen bandwidth also puts extra “mileage” on your device’s hardware. 

By denying ads, you recover bandwidth.

**LibreWolf Special Note**
LibreWolf blocks ads automatically, you just have to keep it updated.

**Do Not Use the Brace Browser**
Many people use this to block ads, but the owner is MAGA. 

Here is an [**Open Secrets record search**](https://www.opensecrets.org/search?q=Brendan+Eich&type=donors "https://www.opensecrets.org/search?q=Brendan+Eich&type=donors") of the owner’s political contributions.

If the old dates on those contributions aren't convincing, just do searches for Brendan Eich and Trump.

***

## **7.5**
**Ad Nauseam**

If you have a little know-how, Ad Nauseam is a way to fight back against ads as opposed to just blocking them. Here are the benefits:

- AN clicks ads for you
- AN hides the clicked ads
- AN blocks trackers & cookies

Because the ads are clicked, it costs advertisers money without gaining any benefit because of the cost-per-click business model they all mostly use. Do your research, but here are some links to get started:

- The [**Ad Nauseam**](https://adnauseam.io/ "https://adnauseam.io/") website has information.
- Here are the [**installation instructions**](https://adnauseam.io/ "https://adnauseam.io/").
- It installs to a chromium-based web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc)
- This link is for [**manual updates**](https://github.com/dhowe/AdNauseam/releases/tag/v3.24.6 "https://github.com/dhowe/AdNauseam/releases/tag/v3.24.6") (not recommended for most users)

***

## **7.6**
**Tor**

The [**Tor web browser**](https://www.torproject.org/ "https://www.torproject.org/") it the best browser for privacy. Here are Tor’s benefits:

- It is free.
- It makes you appear as if you are in a different country.
- It protects you from tech spies.
- Your internet service provider cannot see your activity.

However, it does have some trade offs:

- It is slower (though, tolerable)
- You cannot use ad blockers.
- But most of the ads are in not-English.

Tor is a highly useful web browser that can blind companies. If you don’t mind ads, and want to ramp up your privacy, Tor is an excellent choice.

***

## **7.7**
**Facebook / Instagram**

MZ is supporting the coup, which is why deleting your Facebook account is a good idea. People love Facebook, and the connections it offers. Most people keep it for one or more of the following reasons:

- Family
- Friends
- Groups
- Business

If MZ is helping install authoritarianism, and is a billionaire, then it makes sense to separate from his platform entirely. Consider the follow questions:

White has brought you more joy in life:

- Facebook Chat or Meals with loved ones?
- Meeting with friends or clicking Add Friend?
- Talking online about hobbies or meeting up with like-minded hobbyists.

It is trickier for businesses, because you need money to survive, and FB might be part of how you generate revenue. Let’s consider a few questions:

- Is your online revnue significant?
- If your revenue replaceable?
- Can your online revenue be generated elsewhere.

No one is asking you to suddenly shift from FB or IG if it means harming your business. But as millions of people leave their policies

**Big Tip**
Offer a deal or sale on a new social media platform to increase your customer base. Link to that deal on Facebook. Do this until you see your metrics shift.

**Tip**
Use Facebook and Instagram to drive traffic elsewhere instead.

### **Benefits of Deleting Facebook**

- Reclaim your time.
- You connect more meaningfully with people that matter to you.
- You won’t be exploited by Meta anymore.
- You won’t compare yourself to others nearly as much.

Do a DuckDuckGo search on “The benefits of deleting Facebook.” You will see many articles on that subject, and they are nearly all encouraging.

**Limit Facebook Usage**
If you cannot delete Facebook, consider these tips:

- Delete messenger from your phone (It isn’t private).
- Set a 10 minute timer, use Facebok until it beeps, then log out.
- Actually log out  – FB benefits from you remaining logged in.
- Just check groups you like, then log out.
- Use FB to get others to new platforms like Signal or BlueSky.
- Use ad blockers or Ad Nauseam.
- Unfriend people who add zero value to your life.
- Avoid doomscrolling.

### **Doomscrolling**

Meta spends billions of dollars learning how to hack your brain to get you to doomscroll. Trying to limit your Facebook usage is the same as saying “I alone can overcome their billions in research.” That is extremely unlikely when you consider it.

**What is doomscrolling?**

Doomscrolling is when you spend excessive amounts of time reading large quantities of new, particularly negative news, on the web or social media.

**Why does Meta want us to doomscroll?**

Because they have monetized *all reactions to content*, but negative content does better than positive content. They also have advertisers who want us to doomscroll. Therefore, Meta has turned us all into a service for advertisers.

**What are examples of Meta’s brain hacks?**

**Hijacking “Friend”**
Meta makes you feel like you have more friends than you actually do.

They have also added a meaning to the word friend, and it falls very short of being an actual friend.

**Subversion of Friendship**
It is amazing to me how you can call someone a “Friend” and “Hide” them so you don’t see their posts / comments as much. 

Facebook encourages us to pretend to be friends with people we are not. 

Facebook encourages us to lurk as people we know go through dramatic moments and post about it online. 

While it is bad to air dirty laundry, it also seems weird that we call people “friends” that we don’t care about.

**Annoyance**
When you load up your feed, the first post is half-way exposed. 

This annoys the brain, so you scroll to see it. This activates your muscle memory for scrolling.

**Fake Notifications**
Have you ever checked your notifications and realized “I have seen all this before?” 

That is because you had no notifications to begin with, so Meta gives you some to activate your muscle memory to check things and begin engaging their site. 

People also get minor dopamine hits when they have a message or various notifications. So, there is a physical reward they are exploiting.

**Advertising Filters**
Every like, share, subscribe, follow, and reaction places you in an advertising category. Advertisers can then target you specifically with ads.

**Data Mining & Selling**
Meta sells your data, which is essentially a collection of advertising filters and behaviors, to outside companies like Amazon. 

This is done with your permission legally speaking, but most people would opt out of this if they knew or understood the amount of tracked data.

**Distorting Community**
Groups exist on Facebook, and it is likely the best feature. People do get a sense of community from this; however, many people use online communities to supplant in-person communities. 

Since the inception of Facebook, fewer and fewer community organizations exist, and most have shuttered. So, what happens when the main apparatus of your community is weaponized against you?

**Messaging**
Your private messages are read, and exploited for data. That alone should be chilling to most people.**** The gathered data is also sold off.

**Likes, Shares, Reactions**
All of these make us feel good (ie: dopamine hits). Getting more and more of them is fun, too. However, what happens when your good opinion gets few reactions? Does it mean no one cares? 

After this happens hundreds of times, it wares on you. What happens when a similar idea gets posted by someone else, and they get all the sunshine? 

It is frustrating, and makes Facebook feel like the negative parts of school.

### **Final Plea**

The entire website features big and small brain hacks. Almost all revolve around dopamine hits, which gets you to chase good feelings. 

If your main reasons for staying on Facebook involve connections to family and friends, it isn’t Facebook you are craving, but connections to people. Consider connecting with people outside of Facebook, even if it is fewer people.

If I said to you...

*“Do you want to join my platform? I basically advertise products to you and your family and friends while none of you are seeing one another?”*

...would you do it? 

Maybe not if I asked you in that way, but that is exactly what FB is doing.

All of the above applies to Instagram as well.

## **7.8**
**Delete Twitter**

Twitter is a propaganda machine that manipulates people. Go to BlueSky – it is the perfect replacement, and has millions of users.

Abandoning Twitter de-values the platform. Since Musk used Tesla as collateral to pay for Twitter, as Tesla shares drop worldwide, Twitter is at risk:

- [**Tesla’s Financial Albatross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-Imw_s1aaI&t=1742s&ab_channel=EdwardNiedermeyer "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-Imw_s1aaI&t=1742s&ab_channel=EdwardNiedermeyer") 
- [**Tesla as collateral**](https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/25/23141940/elon-musk-tesla-twitter-margin-loan-buyout-deal "https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/25/23141940/elon-musk-tesla-twitter-margin-loan-buyout-deal") 

***

## **7.9**
**Truth Social**

Truth Social is a propaganda machine for Donald Trump. Leaving devalues the platform.

However, like it or not, Donald Trump is president, and seeing presidential statements matters. 

Therefore, use [**POTUS Tracker**](https://potustracker.us/ "https://potustracker.us/") instead. This gives you Trump’s schedule and doesn’t give his website added clicks etc...

***

## **7.10**

## **Quit Amazon**

Jeff Bezos is helping fund authoritarianism. 

Therefore, quit using Amazon for anything other than a catalog. But why do people like Amazon so much? It comes down to 3 main things:

- Convenience
- Free Shipping
- Selection / Variety

Here are ways to give up Amazon:

- Use it as a catalog
- Find sellers outside of Amazon
- Use eBay
- Use Alibaba
- Search “Amazon alternatives”
- Shop Locally

### **3 Free Shipping Solutions**

3 solutions to free shipping:

- Free shipping is a myth – someone always pays, and it’s you!
- Most places offer free shipping, or free shipping with conditions.
- If you stop spending money in general, shipping is affordable.

Do we really want to allow authoritarianism to take over because we wanted free shipping? 

Stop funding Jeff Bezos.

***

## **7.11**
**Other Social Media**

All social media platforms come at a cost. The costs are simple to list:

- Time
- Energy and Mental Capacity
- Social Life
- Exploited Data

All social media platforms exploit you, and turn you into their product / service. 

For every social media platform, search

- “The benefits of deleting <insert social media platform here.>”
- “<insert social media platform here> scandals.”

Also read the About pages regarding company philosophies before joining.

**8.1**
**Signal Messenger**

[**Signal**](https://signal.org/ "https://signal.org/") makes your texts and calls private. It is free, but donations are appreciated.

Signal only works if both people have it, and it is a replacement for Facebook messenger, conventional text messaging, and other social media chat.

## **8.3**
**Mastodon**

[**Mastodon**](https://mastodon.social/explore "https://mastodon.social/explore") is a de-centralized social media platform. It is growing in popularity, but needs work. It gets better everyday.

***

## **8.4**
**Reddit**

Reddit is an excellent website, but the owner has been pushing negative policies. 

There may be an upcoming mass exodus from Reddit. 

For now, here are useful subreddits to join:

**Federal Issues**

There are likely other subreddits. I’ll add more as I find more or people tell me.

### ***Reddit Update 3-1-25***

Reddit has some upcoming planned changes that may see people exit the website en masse. We’ll see if those unpopular plans get implemented.

### ***Reddit Update 3-11-25***

Reddit has been cracking down on upvotes and posts that contain certain language. It is getting a bit ridiculous, and backlash might be imminent.

**Alternative to Reddit**

The strongest alternative to Reddit is [**Lemmy**](https://join-lemmy.org/).

It is a little harder to use, but it is fine, and works. 

Many people are hoping BlueSky creates RedSky. Perhaps we need to use #RedSky over there a bunch to encourage it?

[**Proton**](https://proton.me/ "https://proton.me/") is a free e-mail service, and offers other services, that prioritizes privacy.

### **Proton Controversy**

It is now without controversy, however. I am including it because Proton, and its policies, are on the right side of internet privacy. However, their CEO certainly caused problems. Here are resources for you to make up your mind:

### **Controversy Conclusion**

I think Proton is a good service and people should use it skeptically. I think holding the Proton team to a standard not to use their platform to spy on people, sell data, and keep everything private is good.

# **Section 9**

# **Build Resilience**

## 
**9.1**
**Protect Your Peace**

### **Stop Arguing Online**

Arguing online costs you time and energy. Learn to differentiate between civil debate and arguing. Never argue – just stop. 

Reclaim your time, disengage from toxicity, and focus your time on resistance activities.

### **AI, Trolls, Bots, Etc...**

The internet is now populated with AI, bots, trolls, bad actors, misinformation, disinformation, and infotainment. All of this exists to harm your psychological well-being. These things each have different goals, but here are some:

- Foster a “Do nothing” attitude.
- Waste your time and energy.
- Radicalize you.

That’s pretty much it. Engage less by understanding toxicity versus civil discussion.

### **B.R.I.M**

Give a person a sentence or two at most. Otherwise, use B.R.I.M.:

- Block
- Report
- Ignore
- Move on

This is a strategy that is outlined in the Debating MAGA section in [**Section 3**](https://drive.proton.me/urls/JZX45YPBVG#HXoSZbDFTcGu).

***

## **9.2**
**Unsecured Places**

Do not discuss your resistance plans in unsecured areas at work or in public. 

Resist all sensitive discussions in conventional messaging apps, websites, or with people who do you have net vetted.

These things can only be used against you later on.

***

## **9.3**
**NC, KC, LC, Gray Rock**

There are 2 schools of thought on this:

(a) Remain in contact with MAGA
(b) Remove MAGA from your life

Both ideas are valid for different reasons, and both ideas have problems. Let’s consider both ideas, and then you decide for yourself what to do:

### **No Contact (NC)**

Cutting off all contact with a person means you regain your time, energy, and resources that were spent on that person. It frees you up of obligations to that person, and from striving for their approval.

The downside is whatever that person brought to your life is gone. Another downside is others may try to contact you on their behalf, and you may have to cut them out, too, if they cannot respect your set boundaries.

Going NC can be especially difficult when it is with family members. However, that is simultaneously when it is most effective, too, because people hate losing family. It does force those family members into introspection. Whether or not they can objectively introspect is another matter (that is up to you to determine).

### **Keeping Contact (KC)**

Keeping Contact means you can always communicate with them, and you remain an open connection for that person to discuss their grievances with. The biggest benefit is you might, one day, be able to convince them of your way, and bring them into the resistance fold. More likely is they will “come into the fold” once they personally get hurt by the coup, as many MAGAs do not care about the suffering of others until they become “others.”

The downside to KC is arguments, stress, and spending your time, energy, and resources on a person who resists you, and might even be hostile toward you while gaslighting you that they are “just kidding.” Only you can determine if this risk is worth it.

### **Low Contact (LC)**

Going low contact is a way to keep communication open, and it is a strategy for people who you cannot go NC with, like a co-worker. Low contact can take on a few different forms. For example, it can mean speaking less and less to a person, or it can mean only speaking to that person about very specific subjects, like work-related stuff.

The advantage to going LC is you limit the time, energy, and resources you spend on a person you don’t want in your life. You also keep the lines of communication open. The disadvantage is the person is still in your life when you don’t want them to be.

### **Gray Rocking**

This is a social strategy where you interact with someone you do not want to interact with, but are forced to, by “becoming a gray rock.” Essentially, your responses and reactions are all flat. “How are you doing today” is met with “Fine” instead of a full explanation of how you’re doing.

Gray Rocking can be used alongside the Low Contact strategy. Its advantage is you protect your peace, which is a huge advantage. The disadvantage is people dislike it, and may approach you more to see what the problem is. In that scenario, you just deny it, state you’re just trying to do your work, etc…

**Narcissism, Politicians, and their Followers**
These social strategies are used by victims of narcissism to deal with narcissists – they are field tested, and very effective. Considering the top politician in the country right now, and his right hand man Tonald Drump, are both huge narcissists, their behavior rubs off on their followers. Consider learning about narcissism more, and you will see the clear patterns.

Familiarize yourself with the terms *Golden Child* (loyal people who constantly seek approval from the narcissist) and *Flying Monkeys* (people who, knowingly or unknowingly, do the narcissist’s bidding). There are parallels currently at work that cannot be ignored.

**Conclusion**
Therefore, it is up to you to determine whether to use this form of resistance or not. At its heart, it is about reclaiming your time, energy, and resources, and pushing toxic people out of your life. But if you are a person who can weather the storm of a person’s behavior to keep lines of communication open, then your goal should be recruitment away from the coup. If you decide to keep communication, that you have a goal: show them the coup is real, and is happening, and how it affects them.

You must find joy in life, otherwise your resistance has no meaning. 

Find joy wherever you can, and always remember the reasons you are resisting.

**Learn Real History**

If you are comfortable learning history, then you are not learning real history. The powerful write flowery, dulled down, whitewashed, do-not-blame-me-I-am-the-hero history.

Here are examples:

*"They were lied to...Harris/Walz and the Democrats *told them* they were being lied to. What do you do when voters want to vote for the 'comforting lie' over the uncomfortable truth?"*

This comment points to the extreme danger of learning whitewashed history. History is uncomfortable, and if you are placated with a comfortable lie over an uncomfortable truth, then you become an enemy of democracy.

**S.E.R.E.**

In the Marine Corps Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) School, resistance training includes handling mind games that captors might use to break your willpower. The training focuses on psychological resilience, maintaining discipline, and resisting manipulation. 

Considering the US government is intending to make people feel powerless, dejected, and push us all into actionless emotions, learning psychological resistance strategies is a good idea right now. Here are key strategies SERE teaches, according to a USMC SERE grad:

1. Control Your Reactions Stay calm: Captors may try to provoke emotional outbursts. Responding impulsively can give them leverage over you. Avoid extremes: Neither appear defiant nor overly submissive. Balance is key.
 
2. Stick to a Cover Story Use the “Big Four”: Name, rank, service number, and date of birth—nothing more. Keep your lies simple: If given a cover story, memorize it and don’t add unnecessary details.
 
3. Recognize Psychological Tactics Isolation: Captors might try to make you feel alone. Remind yourself that your team and country are behind you. Misinformation: They may feed you false intel to make you question reality. Stay mentally disciplined.
 
4. Resist Guilt and Betrayal Traps Guilt manipulation: They may tell you your actions hurt others. Remember, their goal is to break your resistance.
 
5. Use Mental Strategies Compartmentalize stress: Focus on small, immediate goals (e.g., “Just get through today”). Mental rehearsals: Think about how you’ll handle different scenarios calmly. Personal motivations: Keep thoughts of loved ones or personal resilience mantras in mind.
 
6. Build Inner Strength Faith and morale: Whether through religion, personal beliefs, or sheer mental toughness, hold on to what motivates you. Camaraderie: If with fellow captives, find ways to subtly support one another. Avoid learned helplessness: Even in captivity, small acts of defiance (like keeping a strong posture) reinforce control over yourself.

**Flood the Zone**

Steve Bannon created the *Flood the Zone* strategy and it is briefly outlined in Section 6. But how can we resist this strategy?

**Resisting FTZ** 

- Engage less online
- Engage more offline
- Do not be inactive
- Focus your energy 
- Expand your resistance
- Protests are most effective
- Boycotts are effective
- Use Cash, Crash, Commitment (see below).
- Join [**resistance groups**](https://drive.proton.me/urls/5V1AGSKFY0#3wEOsnVAEbuP)
- Take breaks as needed
- Don't quit
- Use strategies in this document
- Flood them back

### **Cash, Crash, Commitment**

I have noticed a trend in their strategies, and I call it Cash, Crash, Commitment:

**Cash**
If it can be converted into cash, they convert it into cash.

**Crash**
If it cannot be converted into cash, or prevents them from converting something into cash, they crash and destroy it.

**Commitment**
If they cannot convert it into cash, and they cannot crash it, they install people who have commitment to Donald Trump and no competence.

Therefore, anytime you see a new story regarding the Trump Adminstration, filter it through Cash, Crash, Commitment. 

It always boils down into one or more of these three things, and makes simplifies the FTZ strategy so you can absorb, and move forward.

# **Section 10**

# **Untested Resistance Ideas**

## 
**10.1**
**Shooting Sickouts**

Every time there is a school shooting, every educator in the country should report being sick the next day:

- It shows solidarity
- It disrupts the country
- It protects against copycats
- It takes a stance

No one wants to politicize school shootings, but something substantial needs to be done. 

The only way it will ever get done is if continuous disruptions occur at all levels.

**Sick Days**
Not every teacher will have enough sick days to do this long term. 

However, each school district has rules for canceling school based on the number of educators and/or students who are absent. 

This means teachers could rotate who calls in sick to preserve and stretch sick days.

**Upside Down Flag**
Everyone should fly their flags upside down for 1 week after every school shooting.

***

## **10.2**
**General Strike Redux**

The gold standard of disruption is a general strike. 

However, getting to that point is very difficult. Therefore, we need to build up to that outcome. Here are some ideas:

**Economic Blackouts**
These are already occurring, but we need more, and we need to tie them to the concept of a general strike.

**Snowball General Strike**
General strike for a scheduled day. If demands are not met, then strike for 2 scheduled days. If demands are not met, then 4 days, etc...

***

## **10.3**
**Junk Protest**

A [**highway in Florida got shutdown**](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/article299490934.html "https://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/article299490934.html") because a milk truck spilled 4,000+ gallons of milk. 

It caused a huge hours long traffic jam. This gives rise to 2 ideas:

1. **The Same Object**
Get a large group of people to buy the same product to cause a shortage. Then, drop this product in the same location within a city as a protest.
 
2. **Any Object**
A large group of people can bring different objects to drop.

This idea works best as a flash mob. 

Another point is this protest will only work if there is a stated purpose. Writing notes on the objects turns this into a protest. For example, “Exercise Article 25” is a good message.

***

## **10.4**
**Sue the Republican Party**

Is it possible to bring a lawsuit against the Republican party, and sue them for all assets? 

They are doing irreparable damage to the country by surrendering their fiduciary duty to uphold things like controlling the power of the purse.

Is this possible?

***

## **10.5**
**End Starlink**

The US Government needs to seize Starlink, and decommission it. 

It has been weaponized, and Musk may have ways to use it even if it is taken from him. 

I think US citizens need to demand its removal.

I think the UN should also demand its removal.

***

## **10.6**
**The Value of Money**

What percentage of people must agree that money has no value before it has an impact? 

I know if 99% of people ignore money, the 1% who has it all will lose a lot of power.

But, where is the line? Is it 51%, or 25%? Or is it going to be as high as 70%?

I know this is weird, and unlikely to occur. But it is a provocative thought.

***

## **10.7**
**QR Flag**

I feel someone needs to make a USA Flag where each star is a QR code. 

The QR code might even be able to be star-shaped, which would make it appear as if the USA is disintegrating.

Each QR code could lead to a useful cause.

# Section 13
Demands

In this section, I will list out popular demands people are asking for.

I will also be listing ideas I think have merit to demand, but that I don't see others talking about.

I will fill out this section as I go -- there are many demands I could put here but doing it all at once will be tough.

# Popular Demands

## **13.1.1**
**Overturn Citizens United**

Unless you can give millions of dollars to a lobbyist, this legislation harms you.

***

## 
13.1.2
Nationalized Healthcare

People cannot leave their employers because they will lose their healthcare.

Health insurance not covering critical procedures or quality of life procedures based on actuarial tables is inhumane. It prioritizes profits above people,

Is it fair to ask a person to choose between cancer treatments, rent, or food?

Healthcare is weaponized against us to force us to remain in dead end abusive jobs. Insurance companies are incentivized to give you less care to increase profits.

Companies dislike nationalized healthcare because they don't want you to leave your crappy job. If a nationalized healthcare society, companies will have to compete for workers by offering incentives instead of hoarding lifesaving care.

***

## 13.1.3
Schumer Steps Aside

Schumer has made too many errors are critical moments in the past few weeks. Many people are calling for him, and Jefferies, to step aside.

***

# My Demand Ideas

## 13.2.1
Job Offsets

There are carbon offsets, so why aren't there job offsets?

**Job Offsets**
If a company offshores X jobs, then the company must pay taxes per offshored job.

If a company automates X jobs, then the company must pay taxes per automated job.

The incentive here is to create jobs and keep jobs within the USA. Otherwise, the company must subsidize UBI so long as those jobs remain offshored or automated.

**Job Elimination**
If a company permanently eliminates a job from the market, they should pay a tax for Y number of years.

The purpose here is to incentivize companies to create jobs, and keep them.

**New Automated or Offshored Jobs**
When new jobs are created overseas, or when new jobs are automated, these should both be viewed as a stolen opportunity from the American people. Therefore, such jobs should still be taxed to fund UBI.

If a new job is so complex a human could not do it, it should still be taxed to fund UBI.

**Efficiency**
If an automated job has a robot doing the job of 10 people, or whatever number, it should be taxed based on that many people minus 1 (as the robot will require maintenance).

**Re-shoring and Re-humanizing**
Re-shoring jobs and re-humanizing jobs lowers the Job Offsets that must be paid.

**Job Valuations for UBI**
The government values each offset based on the industry. This will help combat wage manipulation.

***

## 13.2.2
Universal Basic Income

UBI should be based on Job Offsets. The more job offsets we have, the higher the UBI.

If society still wishes to have money as a concept, then UBI becomes more necessary as more jobs become automated and offshored.

UBI does not mean people don't work, but it does mean they don't have to panic if they lose their job.

**SNAP Benefits**
There would be no purpose in having SNAP benefits if UBI exists. Currently, SNAP benefits account for less than 1.5% of the total US annual budget. UBI could absorb this, and do away with SNAP.

**Other Programs**
Other government programs could end as well, so long as UBI is properly funded. In the end, I believe this will save money, and because desperation would begin to dissolve in most communities, crime would lower, which would save the state money, too.

***

## 
13.2.3
My Body My Choice & Eye for an Eye


**My Body My Choice**
All people should retain bodily autonomy in their healthcare decisions. Here are examples:

1. Dislike abortions? Don't have one.
2. Dislike gender affirming surgery? Don't have it.
3. Dislike vaccines? Don't get one.
4. Dislike vasectomies? Don't get one.
5. Dislike birth control? Don't use it.
6. Don't want your organs donated? No problem, but you cannot be a recipient.
7. Don't want your blood donated? No problem, but no one donates to you.
8. Don't like tattoos? Don't get any.
9. Don't like piercings? Don't get any.
10. Don't want to be resuscitated? No problem, you won't be.

**Eye for an Eye**
Both sides use "My body my choice" arguments. I think it makes sense to allow people to choose what healthcare they do and do not want, but they should have to determine this information on their national healthcare record, too. 

Participating in services means you will benefit from some services, and the opposite is also true, too. It does not make sense to have a lifetime of "I don't want to give organs to anyone if I die" and then be the beneficiary of a heart transplant in the end.

***

## 13.2.4
End Planned Obsolescence

What is the purpose of buying American if it is extremely expensive, but intentionally flawed?

This idea does not mean things cannot break. But engineering objects to break after a predictable amount of time needs to end as a business practice.

**Final Plea**

[**The world is looking**](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1j46edt/we_are_fighting_against_a_dictator_backed_by_a/) at the US citizens, and most of us are sitting on the couch. The world needs us to protest. We must defeat the tech bro oligarchy, fascism, and authoritarianism. We need to hold billionaires accountable, *just like we help people accountable in WWII.*
