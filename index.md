### **Step 3 – Stop Supporting MAGA Companies**

Download the [**Goods Unite Us**](https://www.goodsuniteus.com/) app and learn what companies you support donate money to MAGA. A more thorough view can be seen using the **[www.OpenSecrets.org](http://www.OpenSecrets.org)** website.

# **Donate Now\!**

All projects and groups I list below I feel are important right now. I do not believe Democrats will save us. I believe we need to save ourselves. So, I am recommending people doing the work to save us, and who fight against the coup everyday:

1. [**Election Truth Alliance**](https://electiontruthalliance.org/donate)							**Top Priority**  
   Watch [**this video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyFj3pU7WI0&t=173s&ab_channel=DireTalks). It is imperative we support this group. Also remember, it is the *vote COUNTING machines* they wish to forensically audit, and not the voting machines: those are 2 different types of machines.

2. [**What You Can Do Now**](http://www.WhatYouCanDoNow.org)							**Moderate Priority**  
   This individual is making a website version of this document (at least, that is my interpretation). I cannot do that, so I am grateful for their work. Please consider donating.

# **Option 2 – Protests Dates						RN: 25**

Here is a list of links of when and where protests are happening. This list is not comprehensive, I am just doing my best:

[50501 Protest](https://linktr.ee/FiftyFiftyOneMovement)		List of protests, and useful protest guides

[No Voice Unhead](https://www.nvunheard.org/protest-listings)		Protest map with Information

[Political Revolution](https://events.pol-rev.com/search?search&contentType=EVENTS)		List of Protests, organized by start date

[US Protests Map](https://usprotests.liveuamap.com/)		This website shows protests all over the world

[Protest.net](https://protest.net/?lang=en)			Looks like a cool site, but seems to not be working.

# **Option 3 – Sickouts								RN: 25**

A lower form of protest is a sickout, where enough people within an agency, institution, company, or business are sick, then operations grind to a halt.

This is an excellent way to protest when you are not unionized, but it does still require people to agree. So, keep that in mind.

2. # **Option 4 – Civil Disobedience					RN: 12**

The CIA made a simple 20 page guide to [**conducting civil disobedience**](https://www.cia.gov/static/5c875f3ec660e092cf893f60b4a288df/SimpleSabotage.pdf). 

**Examples of Civil Disobedience**

1\. The USMC Choir sings the [**Les Misrables revolution song**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIQh_5dZUwI&ab_channel=TheDailyFAFO) during the Governor’s Ball at the Whitehouse, hosted by DT.

2\. Yosemite National Park workers / protestors hung the [**US flag upside down**](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/1iwdq3x/american_flag_flown_upside_down_represented_as_a/) as a sign of distress. [**Zion National Park**](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1jafnh1/zion_standing_up_today/) has done the same.

3\. An anonymous person used an AI video of DT ducking EM’s toes: [**The Video**](http://bsky.app/profile/marisakabas.bsky.social/post/3liwlwvvq6k2s).

4\. Someone is using “Reply All” in the gov’t to jam up emails (thread was deleted, but the message got out, so I have no source for it now).

5\. [**Anti-EM billboards**](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1jaagol/billboards_going_up_in_the_uk/).

Civil Disobedience can sometimes be petty, but to be effective, it must confer a message or ideal.Civil Disobedience

# **Option 5 – Mobilize.us							RN: 5**

Sign up for [**Mobilize.us**](http://Mobilize.us) to stay up-to-date on when and where protests are in your area.

# **Option 6 – Bring Friends							RN: 10**

Bring one or more friends to the protest with you.

# **Option 7 – Universal Messaging					RN: 5**

**They Lied to Us\!**  
Make “They Lied to Us\!” signs.

**American Flags**  
Bring an American Flag to the protest.

**Overturn Citizens United**  
No matter what, this needs to be one of the demands of the people. Citizens United is anything but, and it needs to go.

**Divisive Messaging**  
Divisive messaging feels good but might push too many away. Stop the divisive messaging, and unify under “They Lied to Us\!”

# **Option 8 – Join a Union							RN: 15**

Join a union if you can. Unions are an instant community you can join so that you can fight for your rights if they are stripped away.

# **Option 9 – Do Not Be Silent						RN: 25**

Silence is complicity. Silence empowers the oppressor. Silence isn’t voice.

# **Option 10 – Accept Your Role						RN: 25**

We are the ***last line of defense***. You are the ***last line of defense***. No one is going to save you. We need every single person to stand against the regime.

# **Option 11 – Make Signs							RN: 25**

Here are tips regarding making protest signs:

1. Use large bold lettering.  
2. Use clear lettering, and no fancy writing or fonts.  
3. It must be easily readable from a distance.  
4. Use catchy phrases.  
5. Use humor.  
6. Use pop culture references.  
7. Consider “What sign would I want people to see in the news?”  
   1. Profanity might prevent you from being in the news.  
8. Use bright colored fonts, and use a coordinated but limited color palette.  
9. Pictures should be easily understood and associated with your message.  
10. Use symbols that associate with your movement or goals.  
11. Make multiple signs, and give them to people who need a sign.  
12. Print this QR Code and put it on your sign:

    **\<QR Code will be posted after I finalize the URL away from G \_ \_ G \_ \_.\>**

**Universal Messaging**  
Look at the “Universal Messaging” in S1: Option 6 above for more ideas.

# **Option 12 – USA Flag							RN: 25**

We need to use the USA flag at all protests to make them patriotic.

People keep wanting the protest to have a symbol for the movement. I think the USA flag should be the symbol. The other side is using lots of code speak, virtue/vice signaling, N@zi symbols, etc… 

We need to be using 1 uniting symbol: the USA Flag.

# 

# **S2 \- Awareness**

3. # **Option 1 – Share & Download this Document		RN: 10**

Share this document however you can. Download it.

4. # **Option 2 – Resist Bot & 5Calls					RN: 10**

Use [**Resistbot**](https://resist.bot/) and [**5Calls.org**](https://5calls.org/) to contact representatives.

Red State and MAGA people need to do this everyday.

When political leaders do something good, you can use these platforms to tell them that, too.

# **Option 5 – Staying Updated						RN: 5**

Useful news sources that are reporting reasonably:

1. [**Meidas Touch**](https://www.youtube.com/c/MeidasTouch/videos)		**Fastest growing independent news organization**  
2. [**Democracy Docket**](https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/)	**Independent news organization**  
3. [**The Contrarian**](https://contrarian.substack.com/)		**Independent news organization**  
4. [**PBS News Hour**](https://www.youtube.com/@PBSNewsHour) 		**Perpetually objective new source**  
5. [**All Sides**](https://www.allsides.com/unbiased-balanced-news)			**Shows every article’s bias score**  
6. [**BBC World Service**](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/live/bbc_world_service)	**External from the US, so more objective**  
7. [**Reuters**](https://www.reuters.com/)			**External from the US, so more objective**  
8. [**The Guardian**](https://www.theguardian.com/us)		**External from the US, so more objective**

**Truth Social**  
Use [**POTUS Tracker**](https://potustracker.us/) to avoid giving Truth Social direct online traffic. The creator says there is a [**pro version but it is unnecessary**](https://www.reddit.com/r/fednews/comments/1iz64tr/i_built_a_site_that_lets_you_view_trumps_truth/).

# **Option 6 \- What is happening?					RN: 5**

To understand what is happening, look at [**this website**](https://theplotagainstamerica.com/). Here is the same concept in a [**41-minute video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru8SHK7idxs&t=31s&ab_channel=ElectionTruthAlliance%20).

It feels a bit conspiratorial, I will admit. But it is the only thing that makes sense. Why else would they destroy everything, fire veterans indiscriminately, loot the treasury, etc…? 

Canada, Greenland, Ukraine Mineral Rights, and the Panama Canal all fit into a “We need more resources to build our tech cities” narrative. It is sad, scary, but seemingly true.

We must protest, and turn out in massive numbers, to stop this from happening. Then, hold these people accountable by going after them, and their assets.

# **Option 7 \- AMA									RN: 5**

**Subscribe 		[AMA YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@americanmedicalassociation)**

Because the CDC is muzzled, the American Medical Association is giving regular updates on YouTube.

# **S3 \- Recruitment**

9. # **Option 1 – Recruit**

**Recruiting Trusted People								RN: 5**  
Encourage them to go with you to protests. Encourage them to take steps to resist.

Understand that a “Trusted person” can also be someone who stands in opposition with you. In this case, make it personal. Share how it affects you, a person they know. For the LGBTQ+ community, if you are not out to this person, always be careful and use your best judgment. But a personal approach can win people over.

**Recruiting Acquaintances								RN: 5**  
If you are unsure about a person’s politics, discuss topics that touch on hot button issues indirectly and gauge their responses. Here are examples:

1. What do they think of James Bond being cast as a woman?  
2. Talk about a time where you gave money to a homeless person on an exit ramp.  
3. Where do they send their kids to school, and why?  
4. What church do they go to?  
5. Talk about your kids being vaccinated.

Be careful when speaking to people you don’t know very well.

**Recruiting the Opposition								RN: 5**  
Wait for opponents to show moments of doubt, then speak to them. Resist “I told ya so\!” The goal is to defeat authoritarianism, and we need all the help we can get. We can tackle individual differences later.

# **Option 2 \- Arguing with MAGA**

**In-Person Arguing is Best								RN: 5**  
Because of trolls, bots, AI, and bad actors, protracted online arguments are useless. Give a person a sentence or two at most. Otherwise, move on, ignore, block, and report.

In-person debates are best. A good place to start is to get a shirt or hat made in America, and ask MAGA where their MAGA shirt / hat was made.

**No Reaction											RN: 5**  
When MAGA is vile and rude, give no reaction. They experience dopamine when they anger you. If you have no reaction, all they will feel is angry, and heated. Let them feel those feelings, and move on.

**Do Not Provide Research								RN: 5**  
If challenged to show evidence, don’t waste your time. There is always a counter-article to your article. Instead, focus on feels. MAGA reacts first, and thinks (read “rationalizes”) later. Therefore, get them to feel their pain again, and they will be easier to speak to.

**Turning People Away									RN: 10**  
Like it or not, we need MAGA on our side. When they show doubt, do not turn them away. Focus on their pain. Focus on how DT, EM, and JDV have hurt them. Make MAGA *feel* instead of *think*.

# **Option 3 \- Make MAGA Feel						RN: 10**

MAGA hates consequences. But consequences can make MAGA feel. Here are examples:

**Family**  
MAGA hates divided families. They have a purest view of what a family is, and division isn’t part of that viewpoint. Walking away from family is hard, but living under an authoritarian regime is harder.

Section 9 Option 3 demonstrates some strategies for walking away from family.

**Work**  
If you are a business owner, consider firing your MAGA workers. This may seem very harsh, but consider the following:

1. [EM fires people for their views](https://fortune.com/2025/02/28/tesla-elon-musk-jared-ottmann/)  
2. [Political views are not a protected class](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/can-employers-discriminate-based-on-political-beliefs-or-affiliation.html)  
3. MAGA always fights to be able to fire LGBTQ+ people

Like all options in this document, this one is optional. But making MAGA feel emotional and financial pain is our only way to get through to the majority of them. Yes, if you go through this, it will cause disruptions. Yes, there will be challenges, but consider it if they show no signs of remorse for what they have done to the country.

**Friendships**  
MAGA values friends, but less so than family. However, abandoning a long relationship will make MAGA feel pain, and they may have to adjust their life outlook.

**Church**  
If your church is MAGA, find a new church.

**Helping MAGA**  
If you regularly help a MAGA, just stop. Whatever the help, just stop. Let MAGA rely upon itself, and stop draining you and your resources.

# **S4 \- Limit Spending**

# **Option 1 – Open Secrets & GUU					RN: 5**

Use the following to look up corporation political donations before making purchases:

1. [**OpenSecrets.org**](https://www.opensecrets.org/)  
2. [**Goods Unite Us**](https://www.goodsuniteus.com/)

These are free ways to determine which companies lean right, left, or center.

10. # **Option 2 – S.A.V.E.								RN: 10**

Trim your expenses with SAVE:

**Select**  
Select products and services you ***must*** use, and keep using them.

**Assess**  
Determine whether a product or service can be purchased elsewhere.

**Verify**  
If you cannot buy the product elsewhere, is there an alternative?

**Eliminate**  
For all products and services, determine if you can eliminate it from your life.

We need to shift all of our spending habits away from big corporations and toward local business, independent people, and smaller companies in general.

**Spending Tips**

1. Limit spending as much as possible (get ridiculous with it\!)  
2. Eliminate debt when you can.  
3. Avoid products and services with recurring payments.  
4. Avoid micro-transactions.  
5. Avoid loans.  
6. Avoid using credit cards.  
7. Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle saves money\!

Some of this is easier said than done, but do your best. If your spending grinds to a halt, you’ll save more money and might be able to achieve some of these, and other, goals.

# **Option 3 – Move Your Money						RN: 5**

**Credit Unions**  
Credit Unions are owned by people, and not billionaires. Moving your money diminishes the profits billionaires can make by loaning out your money.

**Local Banks**  
Local banks are owned by local people, and not billionaires. They are an excellent option, especially if you cannot join a credit union.

# **Option 4 – Cash is King							RN: 5**

Use cash and pre-paid debit cards instead of credit cards.

# **Option 5 – Boycotts								RN: 10**

**Permanent Boycotts**  
These companies are funding authoritarianism or supporting it through policy changes:

1. [Tesla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-Imw_s1aaI)   
2. G \- \- \- \- e (need to find a new way to host this doc\!\!)  
3. Target  
4. Meta / Facebook / Instagram  
5. Amazon  
6. McDonald’s  
7. Walmart  
8. Ford  
9. Harley-Davidson  
10. Brown-Forman  
11. John Deere

**Upcoming Boycotts**

[**Source**](https://www.yahoo.com/news/boycott-dates-upcoming-045900701.html) **\- [The People’s Union](https://usatpu.org/)**

**Economic Blackout \#1	February 28th, 2025				Success**  
	Amazon Boycott		March 7 \- 14th, 2025				**Success**  
	Nestle Boycott		March 21 \- 28, 2025  
	Walmart Boycott		April 7 \- 14, 2025  
	Economic Blackout \#2	April 18th, 2025  
	General Mills Boycott	April 21 \- 28th, 2025

Many more companies can be added to the list, but these companies are larger corporations. As of 2/27/2025 Target has lost $15 billion dollars due to lower foot traffic. They have backtracked their policies, but people are holding firm. Boycotts work\!

11. # **Option 6 – Citizen Tariffs							RN: 10**

12. Targeting key industries in each state will enhance the economic pain companies feel. Politicians listen to larger companies. Therefore, if Canada, Europe, or China tariffs products in response to DT’s tariffs, then we should respond, from within the USA, with Citizen Tariffs.

A **Citizen Tariff** is when we boycott products made within the USA that other countries have levies against. This means those industries will feel international economic pain, but also national, and state, economic pain.

Kentucky’s bourbon industry, for example, is feeling a lot of economic pain right now. Bourbon brings in nearly [$10 billion annually to Kentucky](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/bourbon-industry-crosshairs-us-canada-trade-war-rcna195906).

**NOTE:** It is extremely difficult to research this per state. Bourbon is easy because it has been in the news a lot, but there are likely other products. If people reach out to me, I can include other products.

13. # **Option 7 – Buycotts Work Too					RN: 5**

Support companies that have reasonable policies. 

1. Costco  
2. Aldi  
3. Trader Joe’s

Each of these companies have good policies, and pay their workers appropriately.

# **Option 8 – Tithing								RN: 5**

If your religious institution supports MAGA, consider tithing elsewhere. 

14. # **Option 9 – Holidays								RN: 5**

Make the holidays about food, family, and friends, and less about stuff. Here are ideas on how to limit holiday expenditures:

1. Spending Caps  
2. Potlucks  
3. Needs over Wants

Celebrate any and all holidays you want, and celebrate them with whom you want. But consider reducing your spending.

# **Option 10 – Fast Food							RN: 5**

Fast food prices are no longer wallet friendly, and most fast food chains support MAGA with political donations. Here are ways to resist fast food:

* **30 Meals**  
  Cooking 30 meals means you won’t repeat a meal for a month. Start bringing your lunch to work.

* **3 Meals per Week**  
  Cooking larger meals means you can eat the same meal multiple times in a week, which cuts down on cooking time. If you cook 3 meals a week, you can rotate meals.

* **Embrace Leftovers**  
  Some meals taste better as leftovers such as soups, chili, stews, and anything similar.

* **Rice and Spice**  
  Rice is cheap, and can be cooked in many different spices. Rice also goes with many different meals, can be served mixed in with food, on top of food, under food, or as a side.

15. # **Option 11 – Streaming Platforms					RN: 5**

Maintain 1 streaming platform at a time. This will save you a lot of money. If we all do this, platforms will be forced to lower prices again, anyway.

16. # **Option 12 – Sports								RN: 15**

If your sports team is owned by a billionaire, stop supporting that team monetarily. Boycotting US football, US basketball, and US baseball would have the largest impact.

I am excluding the WNBA and college sports from this suggestion… for now. 

# 

# **S5 \- Take Action**

17. # **Option 1 – Donate to Election Truth Alliance**

18. [**Election Truth Alliance**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyFj3pU7WI0&t=173s&ab_channel=DireTalks) **needs funding.**   
    **Donate on their [website here](https://electiontruthalliance.org/donate).**

**These people are one of the best chances we have to turn things around sooner than later. They need funding. Donate now.**

19. # **Option 2 – Special Elections						RN 5**

These elections can win back the House of Representatives:

**Florida 6th**  
[Josh Weil for Congress](https://www.mobilize.us/mobilize/event/752077/)  
He is a teacher from Orlando, and endorsed by the Progressive Democrats of America HOME

**Florida 1st**  
[Gay Valimont for Congress](https://www.mobilize.us/gayforcongress/event/747037/)

**New York**  
NY is also having a special election though the date is not yet decided.  
[https://blakegendebienforcongress.com/meet-blake/](https://blakegendebienforcongress.com/meet-blake/)

20. # **Option 3 – General Strike							RN: 10**

[Sign up for the General Strike](https://generalstrikeus.com/), and commit to the general strike when 11 million people sign up.

The [**r/WorkReform**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/1ivpjii/less_talk_more_action/) subreddit has had several posts regarding a General Strike happening on May 1st \- 3rd, and/or May 5th.

**Make Preparations**  
Start making preparations for a general strike now: save money, stock food, etc…

# **Option 5 – Whistleblower Website				RN: 5**

Use this [Whistleblower Website](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.democrats.senate.gov/whistleblowers&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1740703767969969&usg=AOvVaw39T-J9OPxkeFh_PlO8lkG_) for making complaints. This information can be used in court or as evidence of the coup.

If you are a federal worker, strongly consider telling your stories here.

# **Option 6 – Red Cards & Immigration				RN: 10**

When it comes to ICE raids, know your rights. Review, download, and print [Red Cards](https://www.ilrc.org/red-cards-tarjetas-rojas).

Here are other resources:

[What to do if Immigration Comes to Your Workplace](https://www.nilc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/NELP_EmployerGuide_Eng_2025_Final-.pdf)

[Know Your Rights if ICE Visits Your Home](https://www.aila.org/library/client-flyer-know-your-rights) / [Another Article on the same topic](https://unitedwedream.org/resources/know-your-rights/#elementor-toc__heading-anchor-6)

[Know Your Rights with ICE Flyer](https://waisn.org/kyrice/)

[Lots of really great resources](https://crimethinc.com/tools) (not all are free, though)

Knowing your rights can not only save yourself, but save someone you know.

21. # **Option 7 – Identification							RN: 25**

Authoritarian regimes sometimes require citizens to prove their citizenship, which can be very difficult to do. So, get your documents in order:

**Birth Certificates**  
Put your birth certificate in an easy to find location.

If you do not have your birth certificate, you can get a new one printed up at your state's department of vital records or department of health. You will need a proof of ID, and mail with your name and an address. Each state is different, so learn what else is needed.

**Driver’s License**  
Even if you do not drive, obtaining a driver’s license can help you identify yourself. Get a Real ID. I am not providing a link to the Homeland Security website since all government websites are compromised. However, DHS enforces that each state must issue Real IDs.

## **The SAVE Act**

[Here is a non-partisan analysis](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-save-act-overview-and-facts/) of the SAVE Act. 

If you are a woman whose name differs from her birth certificate due to marriage, you may become ineligible to vote due to the SAVE Act. There are a few ways to combat this:

1. Get your passport. This is a lengthy and costly process, so start soon\!\!  
2. Go to the courthouse and change your name back to your birth name.  
3. Get divorced, and change your name.  
   1. For women in questionable relationships, get divorced before you can’t.

# **Option 8 – 4b Movement							RN: 10**

Project 2025 will remove many women’s rights, including the right to vote. The 4b movement is recognition that men are stripping women of their rights, and generally treat them poorly at all levels of society. If you are a single woman or a woman in a questionable / horrible / abusive relationship, consider joining the 4b movement.

The [4b Movement reddit page](https://www.reddit.com/r/4bmovement/) has more information for any women who are considering joining the movement. Men should stay out of that group as it is a space for women.

# **Option 9 – Town Hall: Senator James Cornyn 		RN: 10**

[**Event details are here**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/senator-john-cornyn-congressa-cornerstone-of-american-democracy-tickets-1226581441109?aff=ebdsshother&utm_share_source=listing_android) \- fill the town hall and pressure him to understand the problems he is contributing to causing. This event occurs on 3-31-2025.

# **Option 10 – Vote\!\!\!\!								RN: 10**

Vote.

If you did not vote before, you need to vote next time. So, register to vote.

**Cheating & Election Meddling**  
If they are cheating in the election, still vote.

The reason is because every vote that must be doctored can potentially lead to evidence in court. If they are going to cheat, force them to delete large numbers of our votes for forensics teams down the road.

# **Option 11 – Run for Office						RN: 10**

We need people to run for office who stand for the people.

EM is a perfect example of what happens when a person has too much money. We need candidates who stand up to these people and do not take corporate lobbying.

This means everyday citizens need to begin funding local candidates. When those candidates take corporate money, we need to withdraw our funding to send a message.

We need candidates who will fight to overturn Citizens United.

22. # **Option 12 – Poll Workers							RN: 5**

Volunteer to be a poll worker. The more honest eyes there are at the polls, the more whistleblowers the country will have if things are improper.

23. # **Option 13 – Lawsuits							RN: 5**

If you are capable, or have a legitimate grievance, file lawsuits. Trump’s powers of immunity cover federal level offenses, but not civil offenses. Therefore, civil court may be a useful tool.

For Federal Workers, especially those who have been fired, [**watch this video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_zPZSf-93U&t=350s&ab_channel=RichardAlvey). The key is civil courts, and the monetary damages you can sue for are in the millions. Go after DT and EM personally.

24. # **Option 14 – Taxes								RN: 5**

**Paying Taxes**  
If you pay taxes and do not get refunds, like 1099 contractors, postmark your taxes for April 15th. This denies the government your money for as long as legally possible.

**Tax Refunds**  
If you get a tax refund each year, pay your taxes as soon as possible to get the money away from the government as soon as possible.

**Research**  
Always do your own research, contact tax professionals, and weigh your options.

25. # **Option 15 – Plan 365								RN: 5**

Do 1 thing a day to resist in between protests. Doing more is even better.

# **Option 16 – USPS								RN: 5**

Use USPS when given an option. Avoid FedEx and UPS when possible.

# **Option 17 – Quiet Quitting						RN: 5**

If you work for a MAGA supporting company, start quiet quitting while you look for a new job. 

# **Option 18 – Malicious Compliance				RN: 5**

If you find yourself working for a MAGA supporting company, you can also use malicious compliance.

# **Option 19 – Vaccinations							RN: 5**

According to [CBS This Morning on 2-24-2025](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreak-texas-preventable-symptoms/), the nearly 100 cases of measles in Texas, which has spread to New Mexico, was entirely preventable. 

*“One dose of MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, and rubella, is 93% effective against measles, and the recommended two doses is 97% effective, research shows.”*

It is difficult to resist the coup if you’re sick. Speak to your doctor, and get vaccinated. If you do not have a doctor, speak to a pharmacist.

# **Option 20 – Boycott Tesla						RN: 10**

Because EM is in the government destroying everything, I am listing this item separately from the other mentions of boycotts.

**Boycott Tesla**  
Here is a video that explains the financial technicalities of what boycotting Tesla looks like: [**Boycott Tesla**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-Imw_s1aaI&t=1742s&ab_channel=EdwardNiedermeyer). [**Here is a report**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-just-wrapped-up-its-second-worst-month-ever-210850281.html) that the boycott is working.

EM has also lost over $100 Billion dollars since these boycotts began \- keep going\!

**Stigmatize the Brand**  
Here is how:

1. Encourage others to sell their Teslas.   
2. Discourage others from buying Tesla.   
3. Share social media posts about people who sold their Teslas.   
4. Share social media posts of vandalized Teslas.  
5. Like / Heart / Share / Upvote negative views and images of Teslas.  
6. Refer to Teslas as “Swasticars,” as EM reportedly dislike that.  
7. If you live in a state where you must have a front and back plate, and you see a Tesla or Cybertruck without one: call the police and report the car’s location.

Do the same for all Teslas, including the Cybertruck.

# **Option 21 – Post-it Protest						RN: 5**

Write well-reasoned, short messages, legibly, on post-it notes. Leave them at gas stations, grocery stores, etc… Leave them in places where many people will see them.

This is very cheap and affordable.

Avoid insults. Make good points that are easy to research. Examples:

1. Trump fired people who oversee our nuclear weapons stockpile.

2. There are $4.5 Trillion in tax cuts for the wealthy, and the total tax revenue in 2023 was $4.47 Trillion. Coincidence?

3. As fluoride gets banned, more cavities will occur, and dentist office visit waits will become longer.

4. Why are republicans considered the party of free speech if they ban books?

5. There is a protest happening at \<inset location\> on \<insert day\>.

6. Inflation, egg prices, gas, and groceries are still up in price.

7. Trump wants to take guns from “insane” people, and republicans are passing laws that do not list criteria for what the state can consider “insane.”

8. Executive Orders aren’t laws.

9. If government jobs are wasteful and non-essential, why are government workers not allowed to protest?

10. If you paid money into social security, and social security is gutted, didn’t you just get robbed?

11. If government jobs don’t matter, why are China and Russia trying to recruit disgruntled federal workers? ([source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/28/politics/us-intel-russia-china-attempt-recruit-disgruntled-federal-employees/index.html))

# **Option 21 – Spam DOGE							RN: 5**

EM’s emails are [hr@OPM.gov](mailto:hr@OPM.gov) and erm71@who.eop.gov

![][image1]

For the everyday user, make an anonymous email account, and send emails everyday. 

For programmers, do your thing\!

# **Option 22 – Dept of Ed Form**

Flood the Department of Education with forms reporting real issues schools face. Here are examples:

1. Posting in God We Trust in schools.  
2. Posting the 10 commandments in schools.  
3. School lunch debt issues.  
4. Lack of funding for education.  
5. Low teacher salaries.  
6. Standardized Testing issues.  
7. School shootings.  
8. etc…

[Here is the form](https://enddei.ed.gov/)

# **Option 23 – Reply All**

Many government organizations have a Reply All feature. Generally, people hate it. However, if one person “accidentally” uses it, and then everyone else keeps responding “Stop” or with actual email responses, it will gum up the system.

This is happening in the Federal Government right now because OPM keeps sending EM’s emails to everyone asking them various things to try to pressure them to quit their jobs.

Government workers, teachers, state officials, and anyone with access to a large Reply All feature should take note. When the government begins harassing you to defend your job, this can be an innocuous way to resist.

**Protect Yourself**  
When this occurs, especially if you start it, it must be “an accident.”

# **Option 24 – WaPo								RN: 10**

Cancel your subscriptions to Washington Post. Here is why: [JB directed WaPo](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5309725/jeff-bezos-washington-post-opinion-section) to only cover right wing issues. If you do not like NPR as a source, do a search and you can find dozens of sources on the matter.

# **Option 25 – Pledge of Allegiance					RN: 10**

If you find yourself forced to say the pledge of allegiance, you have 3 additional choices:

1. Stay silent.  
2. Change “one nation under God” to “One nation under duress.”  
3. Stay silent, except for \#2.

# **Option 26 – Privacy Act							RN: 10**

Jaime Raskin is encouraging all US Citizens to file formal demands for access to their personal data obtained by DOGE.

[Here is the article](https://jamieraskin.com/doge-privacy-act-requests/), with links to the form.

# **Option 27 – Adnauseam							RN: 10**

Use the [Adnauseam app](https://adnauseam.io/).

The whole purpose of this app is that it clicks ads, and closes them / hides them. This means you surf the web normally, and it costs companies money.

# **Option 28 – Sticker Protest						RN: 10**

You can create stickers, and post them in public on various surfaces:

1. Telephone polls  
2. Canned goods in the grocery  
3. Sodas at the gas station  
4. Flyers already stuck to things  
5. etc…

You don’t have to vandalise anything, just find surfaces where people will encounter the sticker, and post them.

# 

# **S6 – Build Community**

26. # **Option 1 – Offline Plans							RN: 10**

Make offline plans.

AI is destroying the internet with weaponized bots and propaganda. Tech bros also spy on us, sell our data, and exploit our data.

DT’s friend SB has bragged about the *Flood the Zone* strategy. It is designed to overwhelm the people, the media, and the courts, and to make you feel isolated, powerless, and sad.

The best way not to feel isolated, powerless, sad, or overwhelmed, is to make in-person plans with people. Discuss these problems, build community, and disaster plans. Help one another.

27. # **Option 2 – Shop Local							RN: 5**

Shopping at Non-MAGA-supporting local businesses creates community.

28. # **Option 3 – Stock Up								RN: 10**

Stock up on non-perishable items, and do some research. If times get tough, you will be able to survive the expensive grocery bill longer if you have a cache of food. Learn how to properly store food, and buy containers to help do just that.

29. # **Option 4 – Plant Your Own Food					RN: 5**

Planting food is another way to save on food costs. If you don’t have a yard, consider “Container Gardening.” Here are some quick tips to get you started:

**Climate Zone**  
Determine your climate zone. That will tell you what plants you can grow.

**Lettuce in the Winter**  
Yes, you can grow lettuce in winter. Look into it\!

**Potatoes in a Bag**  
Learn about Fabric Grow Bags, and growing potatoes.

**Cherry Tomatoes**  
Cherry tomatoes take space to grow, but you get a lot of them.

**Crop Rotation**  
Growing crops in the same spot will kill plants due to diseases. Rotate your crops or change out the soil.

**Compost**  
Composting creates nutrient-rich soil that can be used in containers or gardens. As fertilizer and potting soil becomes harder to come by, compost will become *invaluable*.

# **S7 – Eliminate Big Tech**

# **Why remove big tech?**

Big tech is financing and enacting the coup. They…

1. …monitor our communications  
2. …profit off of our attention and online data  
3. …they weaponize their platforms against people

The only way to fight back is to deny the beast battle.

# **Incremental Removal**

Do one thing per day to get away from big tech. The easiest first step is to use other competing platforms to big tech.

# **Option 1 – DuckDuckGo.com 					RN: 10**

[**DuckDuckGo**](https://duckduckgo.com/&search) is the safest search engine. They have a few useful links to learn about their service:

	1\. [**About Our Browser**](https://duckduckgo.com/app?origin=funnel_home_searchresults)	This link teaches you about their service.  
	2\. [**Updates**](https://duckduckgo.com/updates)			This teaches you about their new services and benefits.

It is a step down from the default search engines. However, it is *good enough*. You can incorporate DuckDuckGo into your web browser using the link on their homepage (also, see Libre Wolf in the next Option).

***Update:*** There was a DDG controversy that is worth noting, which is recounted in [**this article**](https://www.knowyourmobile.com/data-privacy/the-duckduckgo-controversy/).

# **Option 2 – LibreWolf Web Browser				RN: 10**

[**Libre Wolf**](https://librewolf.net/) is a free web browser that you can use instead of the popular, or default, web browsers on your devices.

	1\. [**About LibreWolf**](https://librewolf.net/#what-is-librewolf)  
	2\. [**FAQ**](https://librewolf.net/docs/faq/)

LibreWolf is free, and will always be free. They still recommend using DuckDuckGo, but have alternatives listed on their FAQ.

30. # **Option 3 – Orion Web Browser					RN: 10**

The [**Orion Web Browser**](https://kagi.com/orion/) is another browser you can use. They have a $150 lifetime fee for their plus features. It is a very good alternative to Safari for Apple users. 

	1\. Orion offers ad and tracker blocking for privacy.  
	2\. Orion offers access to Chrome and Firefox extensions.

Orion is specifically for MacOS and iOS.

31. # **Option 4 – Use Ad Blockers						RN: 10**

If you do not wish to use Libre Wolf or DuckDuckGo, consider using ad blockers. Ad blockers help you resist in 2 ways:

	1\. You deny ad revenue to large companies.  
	2\. You recover bandwidth.

Every ad sucks away bandwidth – especially video ads – and puts extra “mileage” on your device’s hardware. By denying ads, you recover bandwidth.

**LibreWolf Special Note**  
LibreWolf blocks ads automatically, you just have to keep it updated.

**Do Not Use Brave Browser**  
Many people use this to block ads, but the owner is a MAGA. Here is an [**Open Secrets record search**](https://www.opensecrets.org/search?q=Brendan+Eich&type=donors) of the owner’s political contributions. So, do not use Brave.

# **Option 5 \- Ad Nauseam							RN: 20**

If you have a little know-how, [Ad Nauseam](https://adnauseam.io/) is a way to fight back against ads as opposed to just blocking them. Here are the benefits:

1. Ad Nauseam clicks ads for you.  
2. Ad Nauseam hides the clicked ads.  
3. Ad Nauseam blocks trackers and other similar things.

Because the ads are clicked, it costs the companies money, because every ad click is associated with a cost-per-click.

Do your research, but here are some useful links if you wish to go this route:

1. The [Ad Nauseam](https://adnauseam.io/) website has information.  
2. Here are [installation instructions](https://github.com/dhowe/AdNauseam/wiki/Install-AdNauseam-on-Chromium-based-browsers#install-adnauseam)  
   1. It installs to a chromium-based web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Brave, etc..)  
   2. If you are unsure if your browser is Chromium-based, do a search online.  
3. This link is for [manual updates](https://github.com/dhowe/AdNauseam/releases/tag/v3.24.6) (not recommended for most people).

This is a fantastic option if you are not interested in merely blocking ads.

33. # **Option 6 – Tor									RN: 10**

The [**Tor web browser**](https://www.torproject.org/) blocks your internet service provider, and internet spies, from seeing what you are doing online, as well as where you are in the world. Here are some benefits:

	1\. It is free.  
	2\. It makes you appear as if you are in a different country.  
	3\. It protects you from tech spies.

However, it does have some trade offs:

	1\. It is slower (though, not that bad).  
	2\. You cannot use ad blockers with it.  
	2a. A lot of the ads will be in a different language.

It is a highly useful web browser that can blind companies, and your internet service provider, to your online activities. If you don’t mind ads, and want to ramp up your privacy, Tor is an excellent service that can help resist big tech.

# **Option 7 – Facebook	/ Instagram					RN: 25**

MZ is supporting the coup, which is why deleting FB is a good idea. People love FB, and the connections it offers. Most people keep FB for a few reasons: 

1. Family  
2. Friends  
3. Groups  
4. Business

If MZ is helping with installing authoritarianism, and is a billionaire, then it makes sense to separate from his platform entirely. Consider the following questionnaire:

1. Which has brought you more joy in life:   
   1. Facebook Chat or Meals with loved ones?  
   2. Meeting up with friends or clicking Add Friend?  
   3. Talking online about hobbies or meeting up with like-minded hobbyists?

For businesses, it is trickier, because you need money to survive, and FB might be part of how you generate revenue. Let’s consider a few questions:

1. Is your online revenue significant?  
2. Is your online revenue replaceable?  
3. Can your online revenue be generated elsewhere?

No one is asking you to make a sudden shift from FB or IG if it means harming your business. But as millions of people leave these platforms, you might consider transitioning elsewhere. 

**Big Tip:** Offer a deal or sale on a new social media platform to increase your customer base, and then link to that deal with a Facebook post. Do this several times until you feel you can transition.

**Big Tip:** Use FB and IG to drive traffic elsewhere in general.

**Benefits of Deleting Facebook**  
There are a lot of benefits to deleting Facebook, but here are some of the top ones:

	1\. Reclaim a lot of time in your life.  
	2\. You will find ways to connect with people who matter to you.  
	3\. Facebook cannot exploit you, and you don’t generate revenue for them.  
	4\. You exit a world where you constantly compare yourself to others.

Do a DuckDuckGo search on “The benefits of deleting Facebook.” You will see many articles that demonstrate why this is such a good idea.

**Limit Facebook Usage**  
If you cannot yet delete FB, consider these tips:

	1\. Delete messenger from your phone (it isn’t private).  
	2\. Set a 10 minute timer, use Facebook until the timer beeps, then log out immediately.  
	3\. Log out. FB benefits from you remaining signed in.  
	4\. Just check in on the groups you like, then log out.  
	5\. Use FB to get people onto new platforms like Signal or Blue Sky (see next section).  
	6\. Use ad blockers.  
	7\. Unfriend people who add zero value to your life.  
	8\. Avoid doomscrolling.

FB is ***designed*** to get you to doomscroll. They have spent billions of dollars learning how to hack your brain and get you to doomscroll. Limiting your usage is a fool’s errand, because you cannot overcome their billions in research unless you walk away.

**Final Plea to Delete FB**  
One example of things FB does to get you to doomscroll is the first image on your feed is often only halfway revealed, and you must scroll just a tiny bit in order to see the full image. It is annoying not seeing the full image, and they exploit this annoyance as an initial step to get you to doomscroll.

Their entire website features little brain hacks like this – in this case, it is annoying to see a half-image, so your curiosity is weaponized against you, your muscle memory is the onset to dopamine hits from scrolling, and then you spend too much time on FB being advertised to.

If your main reasons for staying on FB involve connections to people, it isn’t Facebook that you are craving, but connections to people. Consider ways of connecting with people outside of FB.

# **Option 8 – Delete Twitter							RN: 25**

Twitter is a propaganda machine where the willing are manipulated. Just get out of there and go to BlueSky \- it is a perfect replacement, and it has millions of users now.

# **Option 9 – Truth Social							RN: 25**

TS is a propaganda machine for DT, and only the willing will go there to be manipulated. 

34. # **Option 10 – Deleting Other Social Media			RN: 25**

***ALL*** social media platforms come at a cost. That cost is simple:

	1\. Your Time  
	2\. Your mental capacity  
	3\. Your social life (ironically)

There are too many platforms to individually list here. However, for each platform, do a DuckDuckGo search for 

*“The benefits of deleting \<insert social media platform here\>.”* 

Do a little research, and see how you can reclaim your time, and stop being an exploited commodity. Not all social media is horrible, but all of it exploits us. The next section discusses social media and Big Tech alternatives.

35. # **Option 11 – Quit Amazon							RN: 25**

JB is helping fund authoritarianism. Therefore, quit using Amazon for anything other than a catalog. Amazon offers us 3 things:

1. Convenience  
2. Free Shipping  
3. Selection / Variety

Here is how you can give up Amazon, or seriously limit your purchases on Amazon:

1. Use eBay as a catalog, and then buy directly from sellers.  
2. eBay is a reasonable alternative for millions of products.  
3. Alibaba is a reasonable alternative for millions of products.  
4. Do a DuckDuckGo search for “Alternatives to Amazon” – there are lots\!\!  
5. Shop locally.

**But I want Free Shipping\!\!**  
There are 3 solutions for that:

	1\. Free shipping is a myth \- someone always pays, and it’s you\!  
	2\. Most places offer free shipping, or free shipping with conditions.  
	3\. If you do multiple money-saving ideas, you can then afford shipping.

Do we really want to allow authoritarianism to take over because we wanted free shipping? Stop funding JB.

# **S8 – Big Tech Alternatives**

36. # 

37. # **Option 1 – Signal Messenger						RN: 5**

[**Signal**](https://signal.org/) is an app that is end to end encrypted. It allows you to make calls and texts, privately. It is free, but donations are appreciated.

Use Signal to replace the following:

1. Conventional Text Messages  
2. FB Chat  
3. Other social media chat

Signal does require both people to have it. Your messages are encrypted, and safe from the prying eyes of most entities.

38. # **Option 2 – Blue Sky								RN: 5**

[**BlueSky**](https://bsky.app/) has millions of users, and it is what Twitter used to be.

# **Option 3 – Mastodon								RN: 5**

Mastodon is a de-centralized social media platform. It is growing in popularity, but it needs work. Join it now and watch it grow into something more useful.

# **Option 4 – Reddit								RN: 5**

Reddit is still, for the moment, a reasonable platform for discussion. Here are some useful subreddits:

	1\. [**r/FedNews**](https://www.reddit.com/r/fednews/)  
	2\. [**r/FiredFeds**](https://www.reddit.com/r/firedfeds/)  
	3\. [**r/FedDiscussion**](https://www.reddit.com/r/feddiscussion/)  
	4\. [**r/WorldNews**](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/)

Subreddits like r/FedNews, r/FiredFeds, and r/FedDiscussion have been instrumental in getting the word out about DOGE’s illegal firings and illegal misconduct. 

***Update 3-1-25:*** Reddit has some upcoming planned changes that may see people exit the website en masse. We’ll see if those unpopular changes actually get implemented.

***Update 3-11-25:*** Reddit has been cracking down on upvotes and posts that contain certain language. It is getting a bit ridiculous, and backlash might be imminent.

# **Option 5 – Tuta Mail								RN: 5**

[Tuta](https://mail.tutanota.com/login) is an end-to-end encryption email service. It is free for individual users. They are a small company, so temper your expectations. But they do allow you to send emails privately.

Read their terms of service. This is not an email system for sending out mass e-mails.

**Note:** You can email anyone, but it is only end-to-end encrypted if both people are using it.

# **Option 7 – Reading Books						RN: 5**

The party of “free speech” is [banning books](https://pen.org/banned-books-list-2025/), [burning books](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/book-burning), and [banning words](https://groundreport.in/latest/full-list-of-words-banned-by-trump-including-climate-change-8839026). 

Reading ***is*** resistance, and always has been. Anytime a book is banned, read it. 

Support your local library, buy books from authors directly when possible.

When buying books, use [www.BookShop.org](http://www.BookShop.org), as purchases there benefit local bookstores.

# **Option 8 – Go European							RN: 5**

The [Go European](https://www.goeuropean.org/) website offers lots of European based services that can replace many Big Tech apps and websites.

The [r/BuyFromEU](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyFromEU/) is a subreddit where you can acquaint yourself with European products.

# **Option 9 \- Made In Canada						RN: 5**

Try the [Made In Canada](https://madeinca.ca/) website.

Use the website to identify some products near you and support Canada, our best ally.

39. # 

# **S9 – Build Resilience**

# **Option 1 – Protect Your Peace					RN: 5**

**Stop Arguing Online**  
Arguing online costs you time and energy. At the first hint of someone arguing, just stop. 

Reclaim your time, disengage from toxicity, and focus your time on resistance activities.

**Online Trolls**  
Trolls, narcissists, bots, AI, and bad actors are out there with the goal of making you angry, sad, tired, dismissive, or any emotion that makes you ***do nothing***. Stop arguing with these entities. 

Disengage, reclaim your time, and focus your time on resistance activities.

**Block People**  
***Use the block button often***. The more people that block bad actors online, the more their audience shrinks. It takes less time to block someone, than it does to argue.

40. # 

41. # **Option 2 – Unsecured Places						RN: 5**

Do not discuss your resistance plans in unsecured areas at work or in public. Resist all sensitive discussions in conventional messaging apps, websites, or with people who you do not know much about. 

This can only be used against you later on.

42. # **Option 3 – NC, KC, LC, and Gray Rocking			RN: 5**

There are 2 schools of thought on this:

	(a) Remain in contact with MAGA people  
	(b) Remove them from your life

Both ideas are valid for different reasons, and both ideas have problems. Let’s consider both ideas, and then you decide for yourself what to do:

**No Contact (NC)**  
Cutting off all contact with a person means you regain your time, energy, and resources that were spent on that person. It frees you up of obligations to that person, and from striving for their approval.

The downside is whatever that person brought to your life is gone. Another downside is others may try to contact you on their behalf, and you may have to cut them out, too, if they cannot respect your set boundaries.

Going NC can be especially difficult when it is with family members. However, that is simultaneously when it is most effective, too, because people hate losing family. It does force those family members into introspection. Whether or not they can objectively introspect is another matter (that is up to you to determine).

**Keeping Contact (KC)**  
Keeping Contact means you can always communicate with them, and you remain an open connection for that person to discuss their grievances with. The biggest benefit is you might, one day, be able to convince them of your way, and bring them into the resistance fold. More likely is they will “come into the fold” once they personally get hurt by the coup, as many MAGAs do not care about the suffering of others until they become “others.”

The downside to KC is arguments, stress, and spending your time, energy, and resources on a person who resists you, and might even be hostile toward you while gaslighting you that they are “just kidding.” Only you can determine if this risk is worth it.

**Low Contact (LC)**  
Going low contact is a way to keep communication open, and it is a strategy for people who you cannot go NC with, like a co-worker. Low contact can take on a few different forms. For example, it can mean speaking less and less to a person, or it can mean only speaking to that person about very specific subjects, like work-related stuff.

The advantage to going LC is you limit the time, energy, and resources you spend on a person you don’t want in your life. You also keep the lines of communication open. The disadvantage is the person is still in your life when you don’t want them to be.

**Gray Rocking**  
This is a social strategy where you interact with someone you do not want to interact with, but are forced to, by “becoming a gray rock.” Essentially, your responses and reactions are all flat. “How are you doing today” is met with “Fine” instead of a full explanation of how you’re doing.

Gray Rocking can be used alongside the Low Contact strategy. Its advantage is you protect your peace, which is a huge advantage. The disadvantage is people dislike it, and may approach you more to see what the problem is. In that scenario, you just deny it, state you’re just trying to do your work, etc…

**Narcissism, Politicians, and their Followers**  
These social strategies are used by victims of narcissism to deal with narcissists – they are field tested, and very effective. Considering the top politician in the country right now, and his right hand man Tonald Drump, are both huge narcissists, their behavior rubs off on their followers. Consider learning about narcissism more, and you will see the clear patterns.

Familiarize yourself with the terms *Golden Child* (loyal people who constantly seek approval from the narcissist) and *Flying Monkeys* (people who, knowingly or unknowingly, do the narcissist’s bidding). There are parallels currently at work that cannot be ignored.

**Conclusion**  
Therefore, it is up to you to determine whether to use this form of resistance or not. At its heart, it is about reclaiming your time, energy, and resources, and pushing toxic people out of your life. But if you are a person who can weather the storm of a person’s behavior to keep lines of communication open, then your goal should be recruitment away from the coup. If you decide to keep communication, that you have a goal: show them the coup is real, and is happening, and how it affects them.

43. # **Option 4 – The Joy of Life						RN: 5**

You must find joy in life, otherwise your resistance has no meaning. Find joy whenever you can, and always remember the reasons you are resisting.

44. # **Option 5 – Real History							RN: 10**

If you are comfortable learning history, you are not learning real history. Winners write flowery, dulled down, whitewashed history. DT has done it in real time, claiming Ukraine started the war with Russia, for example.

Here are some tips for learning real history:

1. [Lies my Teacher Told Me](https://bookshop.org/p/books/lies-my-teacher-told-me-everything-your-american-history-textbook-got-wrong-james-w-loewen/12897775?ean=9781620973929&next=t&next=t) is a dense, but excellent book as a starting point.  
2. Take a vetted class that teaches real history.  
3. Buy 5 books from different authors about the same time or place and read them.  
4. Buy history books from authors who are native to the area you’re reading about.  
5. Join a historical book club, or start one.


[This comment](https://www.politicalflare.com/2025/02/i-feel-so-stupid-poll-shows-huge-percentage-of-trump-voters-regretful-after-his-sweeping-dismantling-of-american-values/) is poignant. It points to the reason learning real history matters, and the extreme danger of whitewashed history. History is uncomfortable, and teaches how not to commit the same tragedies.

# **Option 6 – S.E.R.E								RN: 5**

In the Marine Corps Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) Schoolm, resistance training includes handling mind games that captors might use to break your willpower. The training focuses on psychological resilience, maintaining discipline, and resisting manipulation. 

Considering the US government is intending to make people feel powerless, dejected, and push us all into actionless emotions, learning psychological resistance strategies is a good idea right now. Here are key strategies SERE teaches, according to a USMC SERE grad:

1. Control Your Reactions Stay calm: Captors may try to provoke emotional outbursts. Responding impulsively can give them leverage over you. Avoid extremes: Neither appear defiant nor overly submissive. Balance is key.

2. Stick to a Cover Story Use the “Big Four”: Name, rank, service number, and date of birth—nothing more. Keep your lies simple: If given a cover story, memorize it and don’t add unnecessary details.

3. Recognize Psychological Tactics Isolation: Captors might try to make you feel alone. Remind yourself that your team and country are behind you. Misinformation: They may feed you false intel to make you question reality. Stay mentally disciplined.

4. Resist Guilt and Betrayal Traps Guilt manipulation: They may tell you your actions hurt others. Remember, their goal is to break your resistance.

5. Use Mental Strategies Compartmentalize stress: Focus on small, immediate goals (e.g., “Just get through today”). Mental rehearsals: Think about how you’ll handle different scenarios calmly. Personal motivations: Keep thoughts of loved ones or personal resilience mantras in mind.

6. Build Inner Strength Faith and morale: Whether through religion, personal beliefs, or sheer mental toughness, hold on to what motivates you. Camaraderie: If with fellow captives, find ways to subtly support one another. Avoid learned helplessness: Even in captivity, small acts of defiance (like keeping a strong posture) reinforce control over yourself.

# **Option 7 – FTZ									RN: 10**

DT’s friend SB created the *Flood the Zone* strategy. This is discussed in **Section 5: Option 1**. But how can we resist this strategy? 

All strategies have a weakness, and no strategy is invincible. Here are tips:

**Resisting the Flood**

1. Engage less online, and engage more offline.  
2. Do not become inactive \- use this doc and other resources to engage.  
3. You cannot save everyone \- focus your energy to make a difference.  
4. Protests are the simplest way to resist everything at once.  
5. Filter everything you see through Cash, Crash, and Commitment (see below).  
6. Join resistance groups outlined in **Section 2: Option 4**.  
7. Take breaks as needed, but don’t quit.  
8. Use strategies in this document to flood them back.

**Cash, Crash, Commitment**

I have noticed a trend in their strategies, and I call it Cash, Crash, Commitment.

*Cash*  
	If it can be converted into cash, they convert it into cash.

*Crash*  
If it cannot be converted into cash, or prevents them from converting something into cash, they crash it, or destroy it.

*Commitment*  
If they cannot convert it into cash, and they cannot crash it, they install people who value commitment to DT over competence to the job.

Therefore, anytime you see a new story regarding this administration, whatever they are doing, it is one of these three things, or a combination. Being able to boil all their heinous actions down into categories like this makes things more digestible.

# **S10 – Untested Resistance Ideas**

# **Option 1 – School Shooting Protests			RN: 1000**

Everytime there is a school shooting, every educator in the country should report being sick the next day. I believe this makes sense for the following reasons:

1. It shows solidarity.  
2. It disrupts the country.  
3. It takes a stance against nothing being done.

No one wants to politicize school shootings, but something substantial needs to be done. The only way it will ever get done is if continuous disruptions occur at all levels of society.

# **Option 2 – General Strike Redux				RN: 1000**

The gold standard of disruption is a general strike. However, getting to that point is very difficult. Therefore, we need a way to build up to that outcome. Here are some ideas:

**Economic Blackouts**  
	These already occur, but are part of a build up toward a general strike.

**52 General Strikes per Year**  
An organization could randomly determine which day of the week (Monday \- Friday) do people strike. The randomness makes it difficult to plan against, and will be very disruptive.

**Snowball General Strike**  
General Strike for a scheduled day. If demands are not met, then strike for 2 scheduled days. If demands are not met, then 4 days, then 8 days, etc…

**Sick Outs & 1 Day Vacations**  
Encourage Sick Outs at specific companies. The best scenario is to encourage sick outs at 3 or 4 companies at a time. The idea would be to select companies that are connected on the same part of the supply chain. This would cause damage that would last passed the 1 day sick out.

Additional groups of companies could experience a sick out thereafter. If these share the same space as the initial companies, then it slows down.

# **Option 3 – Junk Protest							RN: 25**

A highway in Florida got shutdown when a milk truck spilled lots of milk jugs everywhere. The city was forced to clean it up, and a huge traffic jam resulted. Therefore, this gives rise to 2 possibilities:

1. **The Same Object**  
   Get a large group of people to buy the same product to cause a shortage. Then, drop this product in the same location within a city, such as a highway, a street, or a park.

2. **Any Object**  
   A large group of people bring different objects to drop. Objects could include old furniture, blankets, used construction materials, cheese, rocks, etc…

This idea also works best as a flash mob. Another point is this will only work if the protest has a stated purpose. I recommend everyone write the same note on the discarded objects. Examples may include something like “Exercise Article 25” or “Impeach Trump, Vance, and Cabinet.”

# **Option 4 – Sue the Republican Party			RN: 1000**

Is it possible to bring a lawsuit against the Republican party, and sue them for all assets? They are doing irreparable damage to the country, illegally. I think all funds the party can claim as their should be on the line.

Of course, the courts would have to be rebalanced first. But, I am uncertain if a whole party has ever been sued. I am not sure “We’re doing what we were voted in to do” is a defense when it comes to damaging every single citizen in dozens of ways. I am not even talking about entitlement programs \- I am talking about security.

Is this possible?

# **Option 5 – Take Starlink						RN: 1000**

I believe the US Government (ie: Military) needs to take Starlink away from EM, and shut it down. It is a weapon that is used against our allies, and works against the USA. Personally, I think it should be destroyed because even if it is taken away, EM may have a way to use it. 

# **Option 6 – Stop Agreeing Money has Value	RN: 1000**

This is super radical, and very unlikely to happen. However, the thought occurred to me that if enough people agree money has no value, billionaires instantly lose their power. Consider this a thought experiment more than an option.

# **Option 7 – T-Shirt Donation						RN: 15**

I have always wondered what would happen if T-Shirts without expletives were made and donated to various Good Wills around the country. For example “Trump Sucks\!” kind of messaging. It would be great if the back of the shirt had 9+ QR codes for donating to causes.

# **Option 8 – QR-USA								RN: 15**

I feel someone needs to make a USA Flag where each star is actually a QR Code (which could likely still be in star-shape). Each QR code can link to a useful cause, but the flag itself would look as if the USA is disintegrating.

I think it’d be a powerful symbol at a protest, while also giving people the ability to support causes.

# **Coup Evidence**

This section will compile links and documents that demonstrate a coup is happening. Many people do not believe it is a coup, so this section will help people have some resources if it is necessary for any reason:

1. 41 minute video containing EVIDENCE of vote manipulation:  
   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru8SHK7idxs\&t=31s\&ab\_channel=ElectionTruthAlliance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru8SHK7idxs&t=31s&ab_channel=ElectionTruthAlliance) 

2. Whistleblower provides detailed information of the Tech-Bro Coup:  
   [https://america2.news/content/files/2025/02/Musk-NRx-Memo-February-5-2025.pdf](https://america2.news/content/files/2025/02/Musk-NRx-Memo-February-5-2025.pdf)

3. Wealth is shifting to billionaires at unprecedented rates. Here is a report from the Senate Floor in Washington DC from Senator Chris Murphy:  
   [https://www.reddit.com/r/fednews/comments/1ix2hlw/from\_the\_senate\_floor\_shifting\_wealth\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fednews/comments/1ix2hlw/from_the_senate_floor_shifting_wealth_to/)

4. If DOGE is about efficiency, cutting government waste, and saving money, why do republicans want to raise the debt ceiling by [$4 trillion dollars](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-budget-bill-4-5t-tax-cuts-survives-key-hurdle-despite-house-gop-infighting)?

   How is it possible to pay down our debt if we increase the debt limit by $4 trillion? Wouldn’t it make more sense to “cut wasteful spending” and then not raise the debt?

   This is more evidence we’re experiencing an economic coup. “Paying for tax cuts” and “Fiscal responsibility” do not go hand in hand if you make budget cuts but then spend more money than you’re cutting.

   It would make more sense to make massive cuts, and spend $0 additionally, and to raise taxes to pay off the debt.

5. [BallotProof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIgD6uBz_TM&t=403s&ab_channel=TheDailyShow) \- This alone is not evidence, but putting it here to keep an eye on it.

6. [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5166003-tech-billionaire-elon-musk-government-jobs/) reports republicans are in the dark as to how to make complaints about DOGE. This matters because it means DT and friends are trying to rule the country and keep republicans out of the way, too.

9. [US looking into Russian sanctions relief](https://www.reuters.com/world/white-house-seeks-plan-possible-russia-sanctions-relief-sources-say-2025-03-03/). Russia is our enemy, and has been for a long time. How does this truly benefit us? The sanctions began because Russia invaded a sovereign nation, unprovoked.

10.  The list of banned words from the Whitehouse is incredibly long.

11. [Denial of truth](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-03-13/ty-article/musk-shares-claim-that-stalin-hitler-didnt-murder-millions-public-sector-workers-did/00000195-8ee8-d155-affd-8fec8f8e0000), and trying to re-write history.

# **Final Plea**

The world is looking at us, and most of us are still sitting on the couch. The world needs us to protest. We must defeat the tech bro oligarchy. We need to then hold billionaires accountable *just like we held people accountable in WWII*.
